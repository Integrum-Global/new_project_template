# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Kailash Python SDK project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR should be stored in the `guide/adr/` directory with a filename pattern of `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` where `NNNN` is a sequential number.

```
guide/
â””â”€â”€ adr/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 0001-base-node-interface.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ 0002-workflow-representation.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ 0003-local-execution-strategy.md
    â””â”€â”€ README.md  # Overview of the ADR process
```

## ADR Template

We use the following format for ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Title of the Decision

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX]

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

Describe the circumstances and forces at play, including technological, political, social, project-specific, and organizational factors that influenced the decision.

## Decision

State the decision made clearly and concisely. Explain the "what" not the "how" of implementation.

## Rationale

Explain why this decision was made, what alternatives were considered, and why they were rejected.

## Consequences

Describe the resulting context after applying the decision, including both positive and negative consequences. Include any risks introduced and mitigations.

## Implementation Notes

Optional section for specific implementation details, guidelines, or considerations.

## Process for Creating ADRs

1. **Identification**: Identify the need for an architectural decision
2. **Discussion**: Discuss the decision with team members
3. **Documentation**: Document the decision using the ADR template
4. **Review**: Review the ADR with stakeholders
5. **Status Update**: Update the status
   - **Proposed**: Initial creation and discussion
   - **Accepted**: Decision has been agreed upon
   - **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant
   - **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR (reference the new one)
6. **Implementation**: Implement the decision as described
7. **Update**: Update the ADR if the decision changes or evolves

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making a significant architectural decision that:

1. Has a significant impact on the system architecture
2. Affects multiple components or subsystems
3. Has long-term implications for maintenance or extensibility
4. Represents a choice between multiple viable alternatives
5. Changes a previous architectural decision

## Maintenance of ADRs

ADRs should be treated as immutable once accepted. If a decision needs to be changed:

1. Create a new ADR that references the old one
2. Update the status of the old ADR to "Superseded by ADR-XXXX"
3. Include a clear explanation of why the decision was changed

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template
2. Name it using sequential numbering: `NNNN-short-title.md`
3. Update the status (typically starts as "Proposed")
4. Fill in all sections

## Project Status

As of 2025-06-03, the Kailash Python SDK has achieved major milestones:
- **100% test pass rate** (678/678 tests passing)
- **All core architectural decisions** implemented and validated
- **Hierarchical RAG** fully implemented with 7 specialized nodes
- **Workflow API Wrapper** enabling REST API exposure in 3 lines of code

- **GitHub Actions** passing completely with documentation pipeline
- **Code Quality** All linting issues resolved, pre-commit hooks configured

### Next Phase: Agentic AI Implementation (Q1 2025)

The project is entering a new phase focused on agentic AI capabilities:

1. **Phase 1 Implementation** (8-10 weeks):
   - **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for advanced context sharing
   - **A2A Communication**: Agent-to-Agent coordination and message passing
   - **LLM Agent Node**: Real integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI
   - **EmbeddingGeneratorNode**: Vector embeddings for RAG systems

2. **Client Requirements**: Active projects using LangChain/Langgraph need production-ready:
   - Multi-agent workflow coordination
   - Real LLM integration (not mock implementations)
   - Context sharing between AI models and tools
   - Function calling and tool execution

3. **Architecture Foundation**: New ADRs provide roadmap for:
   - MCP protocol integration patterns
   - Distributed agent communication
   - Production-ready LLM agent architecture
   - Integration with existing async and API infrastructure
