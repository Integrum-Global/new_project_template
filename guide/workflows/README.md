## üéØ Solution Development Process Overview

### 5-Phase Workflow
1. **Discovery & Planning** - Requirements analysis and solution design
2. **Implementation & Integration** - Development and system integration
3. **Testing & Validation** - Quality assurance and performance testing
4. **Documentation & Deployment Prep** - Documentation and production preparation
5. **Deployment & Monitoring** - Production deployment and monitoring setup

### Process Principles
- **Solution-Focused**: Build for business value and production deployment
- **Quality-First**: Comprehensive testing and validation at each phase
- **Documentation-Heavy**: Document decisions, patterns, and lessons learned
- **Iterative**: Learn from mistakes and continuously improve

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### With Todo Management
- Each phase has corresponding tasks in `guide/todos/000-master.md`
- Active tasks tracked in `guide/todos/active/` files
- Completed sessions archived in `guide/todos/completed/`

### With Mistake Tracking
- Issues tracked in `guide/mistakes/current-session-mistakes.md`
- Patterns documented in `guide/mistakes/README.md`
- Solutions integrated into workflow improvements

### With Reference Documentation
- API usage guided by `reference/api/` specifications
- Patterns from `reference/pattern-library/` inform solution design
- Quick reference via `reference/cheatsheet/` during implementation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For New Solutions
1. Start with [solution-development-phases.md](solution-development-phases.md)
2. Use `reference/pattern-library/` for solution patterns
3. Track progress in `guide/todos/000-master.md`
4. Follow deployment guide for production readiness

### For Legacy Migration
1. Start with [migration-workflow.md](migration-workflow.md)
2. Assess existing system and plan migration strategy
3. Use migration templates and patterns
4. Follow gradual cutover procedures

### For Deployment
1. Follow [deployment-workflow.md](deployment-workflow.md)
2. Complete [validation-checklist.md](validation-checklist.md)
3. Use deployment patterns from `reference/cheatsheet/006-deployment-patterns.md`
4. Set up monitoring and alerting

## üìä Process Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Time to First Solution**: Target < 4 hours for standard patterns
- **Deployment Frequency**: Target daily deployments for active projects
- **Lead Time**: From requirements to production < 1 week

### Quality Metrics
- **Defect Rate**: < 5% of deployed solutions have critical issues
- **Test Coverage**: > 90% for all solution components
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of solutions have complete documentation

### Learning Metrics
- **Mistake Recurrence**: < 10% repeat of documented mistakes
- **Process Improvement**: Monthly workflow refinements based on lessons learned
- **Knowledge Sharing**: All lessons captured and documented

## üîß Workflow Customization

### Project-Specific Adaptations
- Add project-specific phases for complex requirements
- Customize validation criteria for different domains
- Adapt deployment procedures for specific environments
- Include domain-specific quality gates

### Team-Specific Modifications
- Adjust phase durations based on team size and experience
- Customize documentation requirements for team needs
- Adapt review processes for team structure
- Include team-specific tools and technologies
