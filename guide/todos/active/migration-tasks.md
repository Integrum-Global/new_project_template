# Migration Tasks - Active Development

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: Planning  
**Focus**: Legacy system migration to Kailash SDK

## Current Migration Projects

### Template Synchronization Migration
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Target**: Update new_project_template with kailash_python_sdk enhancements
- **Progress**: 60% complete (3/5 phases done)
- **Timeline**: Complete by end of current session

## Standard Migration Workflow

### Phase 1: Assessment & Planning
- [ ] **System Analysis**
  - Document existing architecture and data flows
  - Identify integration points and dependencies
  - Assess data volumes and performance requirements
  - Catalog business logic and transformation rules

- [ ] **Kailash Mapping**
  - Map existing components to Kailash nodes
  - Identify custom node requirements
  - Plan workflow architecture and connections
  - Design error handling and monitoring strategy

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Preparation
- [ ] **Environment Setup**
  - Install Kailash SDK and dependencies
  - Configure development and testing environments
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines for solution deployment
  - Establish monitoring and logging infrastructure

- [ ] **Data Migration Strategy**
  - Plan data extraction and transformation processes
  - Design validation and rollback procedures
  - Set up parallel running capabilities
  - Create data quality validation rules

### Phase 3: Implementation & Testing
- [ ] **Core Workflow Development**
  - Implement primary business workflows using Kailash
  - Create custom nodes for specialized logic
  - Integrate with external systems and APIs
  - Implement error handling and retry logic

- [ ] **Validation & Testing**
  - Unit test all workflow components
  - Integration test with real data samples
  - Performance test with production-like volumes
  - Security test authentication and authorization

### Phase 4: Deployment & Cutover
- [ ] **Production Deployment**
  - Deploy Kailash solution to production environment
  - Configure monitoring and alerting systems
  - Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures
  - Train operations team on new system

- [ ] **Gradual Cutover**
  - Run legacy and Kailash systems in parallel
  - Gradually migrate traffic to new system
  - Monitor performance and error rates
  - Complete cutover when validation passes

## Migration Templates

### Common Migration Patterns

#### 1. **ETL Pipeline Migration**
```python
# Legacy system → Kailash workflow
# From: Cron jobs + shell scripts + manual processes
# To: Automated Kailash workflows with monitoring

workflow = Workflow("legacy_etl_migration")
# Add data source nodes
# Add transformation logic
# Add error handling
# Add monitoring
```

#### 2. **API Integration Migration**
```python
# Legacy system → Modern API integration
# From: Point-to-point custom integrations
# To: Standardized API gateway patterns

workflow = Workflow("api_integration_migration")
# Use RESTClientNode for external APIs
# Add authentication and rate limiting
# Implement retry and fallback logic
```

#### 3. **Report Generation Migration**
```python
# Legacy system → AI-enhanced reporting
# From: Static report templates
# To: Dynamic, AI-powered insights

workflow = Workflow("reporting_migration")
# Add data aggregation
# Add LLM analysis nodes
# Add automated distribution
```

## Migration Documentation Templates

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Business requirements documented
- [ ] Current system architecture mapped
- [ ] Data flow diagrams created
- [ ] Integration points identified
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Security requirements defined
- [ ] Compliance requirements verified
- [ ] Rollback procedures planned

### Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] All business functions verified
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds baselines
- [ ] Error rates within acceptable limits
- [ ] Security controls functioning
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team training completed
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off obtained

## Success Stories & Patterns

### Typical Migration Benefits
- **Development Speed**: 3-5x faster development cycles
- **Maintainability**: Standardized patterns and documentation
- **Reliability**: Built-in error handling and monitoring
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native deployment patterns

### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Legacy Data Formats**: Use transformation nodes and validation
- **Complex Business Logic**: Create custom nodes for specialized logic
- **Integration Dependencies**: Use API nodes with proper error handling
- **Performance Requirements**: Implement async patterns and optimization

## Risk Management

### Migration Risks
- **Data Loss**: Mitigated by parallel running and validation
- **Downtime**: Minimized by gradual cutover strategy
- **Performance Issues**: Addressed by load testing and optimization
- **Integration Failures**: Handled by comprehensive testing and fallbacks

### Contingency Plans
- **Rollback Procedures**: Documented for each migration phase
- **Support Escalation**: Clear escalation paths for issues
- **Communication Plan**: Stakeholder updates and status reporting
- **Resource Allocation**: Dedicated team members for migration support

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete template sync** - Finish new_project_template updates
2. **Create migration guides** - Document standard patterns and procedures
3. **Test migration patterns** - Validate with sample legacy systems
4. **Update documentation** - Ensure all guides are current and accurate
