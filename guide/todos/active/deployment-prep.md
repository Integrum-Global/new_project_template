## Deployment Patterns

### Cloud Platform Configurations

#### AWS Deployment
```yaml
# ECS Fargate deployment configuration
service:
  name: kailash-solution
  platform: fargate
  cpu: 512
  memory: 1024
  replicas: 3
  load_balancer: true
  health_check: "/health"
```

#### Azure Deployment
```yaml
# Azure Container Instances
containerGroup:
  name: kailash-solution
  osType: Linux
  restartPolicy: Always
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: solution:latest
      cpu: 0.5
      memory: 1.0
```

#### GCP Deployment
```yaml
# Cloud Run deployment
service:
  name: kailash-solution
  platform: managed
  region: us-central1
  traffic:
    - percent: 100
      latestRevision: true
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations

#### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Feature development and testing
- **Resources**: Minimal resource allocation
- **Data**: Test data and mock services
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging and metrics

#### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production validation
- **Resources**: Production-like resource allocation
- **Data**: Sanitized production data
- **Monitoring**: Full monitoring and alerting

#### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live business operations
- **Resources**: Full resource allocation with auto-scaling
- **Data**: Live production data
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and incident response

## Deployment Automation

### CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions deployment pipeline
name: Deploy Kailash Solution
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Build and test
      - name: Security scan
      - name: Deploy to staging
      - name: Integration tests
      - name: Deploy to production
      - name: Post-deployment verification
```

### Deployment Scripts
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/CloudFormation templates
- **Application Deployment**: Kubernetes manifests or container configs
- **Database Migrations**: SQL scripts with rollback procedures
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific config files

### Rollback Procedures
- **Automated Rollback**: Triggered by health check failures
- **Manual Rollback**: Step-by-step procedures for emergency situations
- **Data Rollback**: Database restoration procedures
- **Communication Plan**: Stakeholder notification procedures

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Deployment Validation
- [ ] **Code Quality**
  - All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
  - Code coverage meets threshold (>90%)
  - Security scan results acceptable
  - Performance benchmarks met

- [ ] **Infrastructure Validation**
  - Infrastructure provisioned correctly
  - Network connectivity verified
  - External dependencies available
  - Backup systems operational

- [ ] **Business Validation**
  - User acceptance testing completed
  - Performance requirements validated
  - Security requirements verified
  - Compliance requirements met

### Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] **Operational Verification**
  - Health checks passing
  - Metrics within expected ranges
  - Error rates below threshold
  - Response times acceptable

- [ ] **Business Verification**
  - Core business functions operational
  - Integration points functioning
  - Data quality within standards
  - User feedback positive

## Risk Management

### Deployment Risks
- **Service Disruption**: Mitigated by blue-green deployment
- **Data Corruption**: Prevented by backup and validation procedures
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Addressed by security scanning and controls
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitored and auto-scaled

### Incident Response
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear paths for different severity levels
- **Communication Plans**: Stakeholder notification and updates
- **Recovery Procedures**: Step-by-step restoration processes
- **Post-Incident Reviews**: Learning and improvement processes

## Success Metrics

### Deployment Success Criteria
- **Zero Downtime**: Deployments complete without service interruption
- **Fast Recovery**: Rollback possible within 5 minutes if needed
- **Automated Validation**: 95% of validation automated
- **Predictable Timeline**: Deployment windows consistently met

### Operational Success Criteria
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA met
- **Performance**: Response times within acceptable ranges
- **Error Rates**: Less than 0.1% error rate
- **Security**: Zero security incidents

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete infrastructure templates** - Finalize deployment configurations
2. **Test deployment automation** - Validate CI/CD pipelines
3. **Security review** - Complete security configuration
4. **Documentation update** - Ensure all procedures documented
