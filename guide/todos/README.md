# TODO Management System - Solution Development

**Version**: Template-adapted from Kailash SDK 0.1.4  
**Focus**: Task tracking for business solution development

## üìÅ File Structure

### Core Files
- **`000-master.md`** - ACTIVE TODO LIST (Always check first!)
  - Current session status and immediate priorities
  - Tasks in progress and pending
  - Recent achievements and progress tracking
  - Session statistics and completion estimates

### Organization Directories

#### `active/` - Active Implementation Plans
- **`solution-features.md`** - Active solution development tasks
- **`migration-tasks.md`** - Legacy system migration tasks  
- **`deployment-prep.md`** - Production readiness and deployment tasks

#### `completed/` - Historical Session Records
- **`README.md`** - Explains numbering system and archive organization
- **`001-xxx.md`** - Individual session files with detailed notes
- **`002-xxx.md`** - Chronological record of completed work

## üéØ Solution Development Focus

### Task Categories for Solutions
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Understanding business needs and constraints
2. **Architecture Design** - Solution design and technical planning
3. **Integration Planning** - External system connections and APIs
4. **Implementation** - Core development and coding tasks
5. **Testing & Validation** - Quality assurance and performance testing
6. **Deployment Preparation** - Production readiness and deployment planning
7. **Documentation** - User guides, technical docs, and knowledge transfer
8. **Monitoring Setup** - Observability and alerting configuration

### Priority Levels
- **üî• High**: Critical path items, blockers, urgent client needs
- **üìã Medium**: Important features, planned improvements, technical debt
- **üí° Low**: Nice-to-have features, optimizations, future considerations

### Status Indicators
- **‚úÖ Completed**: Task finished and validated
- **üîÑ In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **‚è≥ Pending**: Scheduled but not started
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies or external factors
- **‚ùå Cancelled**: No longer needed or deprioritized

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start of Session**: Check `000-master.md` for current priorities
2. **Task Selection**: Choose highest priority pending task
3. **Status Update**: Mark task as "In Progress" in master list
4. **Work Execution**: Implement solution following 5-phase workflow
5. **Completion**: Mark as "Completed" immediately when done
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant active/ files with progress notes

### Weekly Review
1. **Review Completed Tasks**: Move completed items to numbered session files
2. **Update Active Plans**: Refresh active/ files with new requirements
3. **Prioritize Backlog**: Reorder pending tasks based on business value
4. **Archive Old Sessions**: Move old session files to completed/ directory

### Project Phases
1. **Discovery Phase**: Focus on requirements and architecture tasks
2. **Implementation Phase**: Development and integration tasks
3. **Testing Phase**: Quality assurance and validation tasks
4. **Deployment Phase**: Production preparation and deployment tasks
5. **Monitoring Phase**: Observability and maintenance tasks

## üìä Task Management Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Effective Task Management
- **Atomic Tasks**: Break large features into small, actionable items
- **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Define what "done" means for each task
- **Time Estimation**: Include realistic effort estimates
- **Dependency Tracking**: Note prerequisites and blockers
- **Business Value**: Link tasks to business outcomes and user needs

### ‚ùå Common Pitfalls
- Vague task descriptions without clear deliverables
- Large monolithic tasks that can't be completed in one session
- Missing dependencies causing unexpected blockers
- Forgetting to update status when starting/completing tasks
- Not documenting lessons learned from completed work

## üîó Integration with Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning
- Review `000-master.md` for current session status
- Update active/ files with new requirements and constraints
- Create implementation plan with task breakdown

### Phase 2: Implementation & Integration  
- Mark tasks as "In Progress" when starting work
- Track issues in `guide/mistakes/current-session-mistakes.md`
- Update progress notes in relevant active/ files

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- Document validation tasks and results
- Update deployment readiness in `deployment-prep.md`
- Prepare for production deployment

### Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment Prep
- Complete documentation tasks
- Finalize deployment preparation checklist
- Update solution documentation

### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
- Execute deployment tasks
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Document post-deployment tasks and handover
