## Pattern Usage

### How to Use Patterns

1. **Select Pattern**: Choose relevant industry or use case
2. **Review Template**: Study the pattern structure
3. **Customize**: Adapt to your specific needs
4. **Test**: Follow testing best practices
5. **Deploy**: Use production deployment patterns

### Pattern Structure

Each pattern includes:
- **Overview**: Use case description
- **Architecture**: Workflow design
- **Nodes Used**: Required nodes
- **Configuration**: Parameter setup
- **Example Code**: Working implementation
- **Best Practices**: Production tips
- **Testing**: Test strategies

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need:
- Industry-specific workflow templates
- Production-ready starting points
- Common use case implementations
- Best practice examples
- Workflow design inspiration
- Pattern-based development

## Implementation Tips

### Starting from Patterns

```python
# 1. Copy pattern template
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()

# 2. Add nodes from pattern
workflow.add_node("NodeType", "id", {...})

# 3. Customize parameters
# 4. Add industry-specific logic
# 5. Test with real data
```

### Combining Patterns

- Mix patterns for complex workflows
- Use common patterns as building blocks
- Adapt industry patterns to your domain
- Layer security patterns on all workflows
