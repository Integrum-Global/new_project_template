# Todo ‚Üî GitHub Issues Synchronization Guide

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13
**Purpose**: Maintain perfect 1:1 sync between local todo system and GitHub issues/projects

---

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth per Concern
- **Local Todos** (`todos/`): Detailed implementation plans, ADRs, checklists
- **GitHub Issues**: Public tracking, team coordination, story points, sprint assignment
- **Both Must Sync**: Status, story points, dependencies, completion dates

### 2. Naming Conventions

#### User Stories (Primary Todos)
**Format**: `TODO-XXX-feature-name.md` ‚Üí `Story X: Feature Name (N pts)`

**Examples:**
```
TODO-001-search-filter-contacts.md
  ‚Üí Issue #1: "Story 1: Search & Filter Centralised Contacts (8 pts)"

TODO-017-core-intelligence-infrastructure.md
  ‚Üí Issue #21: "Story 17: Core Intelligence Infrastructure (13 pts)"
```

**Rules:**
- **CRITICAL**: Story number MUST EXACTLY match TODO number. NO EXCEPTIONS.
  - TODO-001 = Story 1
  - TODO-016 = Story 16
  - TODO-031 = Story 31 (NOT Story 22, NOT Story 20, exactly 31)
  - TODO-032 = Story 32 (NOT Story 23, exactly 32)
  - TODO-033 = Story 33 (NOT Story 20, exactly 33)
  - TODO-034 = Story 34 (NOT Story 21, exactly 34)
  - **Sub-issues have TODO numbers and uses "Story N (sub-issue):" titles**
  - Sub-issues use descriptive titles like "P0: Feature Name" with parent:story-X labels
  - **This rule is MANDATORY and STRICTLY ENFORCED. Violations must be corrected immediately.**
- Title MUST include story points in parentheses
- Title MUST be descriptive of the feature
- NO "TODO-" prefix in GitHub issue titles (use "Story X" instead for user stories)

#### Sub-Issues (Implementation Tasks)
**Format**: `Story N (sub-issue): Descriptive Title (X pts)`

**Examples:**
```
"Story 1 (sub-issue): P0 Search Contacts - Critical UX Fixes (5 pts)"
  ‚Üí Sub-issue of Issue #1 (Story 1: Search & Filter)
  ‚Üí Label: "parent:story-1"

"Story 7 (sub-issue): Backend Login Workflow Implementation (8 pts)"
  ‚Üí Sub-issue of Issue #7 (Story 7: RBAC)
  ‚Üí Label: "parent:story-7"
```

**Rules:**
- **CRITICAL**: Title MUST start with "Story N (sub-issue):" where N is the parent story number
- This makes tracking much easier - you can immediately see which story a sub-issue belongs to
- MUST have `parent:story-N` label linking to parent issue
- CAN have story points if they're part of the parent's total
- CAN use prefixes after sub-issue marker: "Story 1 (sub-issue): P0:", "Story 7 (sub-issue): Enhancement:", etc.

### 3. Story Number Mapping

| Local TODO | GitHub Issue | Story # | Status |
|------------|--------------|---------|--------|

**Notes**:
- Story numbers STRICTLY match TODO numbers
- Sub-issues are titled "Story N (sub-issue): Description" for easy tracking
- Sub-issues keep their TODO numbers (TODO-020, TODO-021, etc.)

## üìã Synchronization Workflows

### Workflow 1: Creating a New User Story

**Local (todo-manager)**:
1. Create `todos/active/TODO-XXX-feature-name.md`
2. Add to `todos/000-master.md` with:
   - Story points
   - Priority (P0/P1/P2)
   - Phase assignment
   - Dependencies
   - GitHub Issue: `#TBD`

**GitHub (gh-manager)**:
3. Create issue with title: `Story X: Feature Name (N pts)`
4. Add labels:
   - Priority: `p0`, `p1`, or `P0-critical`, `P1-important`, `P2-polish`
   - Phase: `phase-1-foundation`, `phase-2-core`, `phase-3-quality`, `phase-4-intelligence`
   - Sprint: `sprint-1`, `sprint-2`, `sprint-3` (if assigned)
   - Status: `ready-to-start`
5. Set description with:
   - Phase and priority explanation
   - Dependencies (links to blocking issues)
   - What this unblocks (links to dependent issues)
   - Story points and effort estimate
   - Acceptance criteria

**Sync Back (todo-manager)**:
6. Update `TODO-XXX-feature-name.md` header:
   ```markdown
   - GitHub Issue: #YY
   ```
7. Update `todos/000-master.md`:
   ```markdown
   - TODO-XXX: Feature Name
     - GitHub Issue: #YY
   ```

### Workflow 2: Starting Work on a Story

**Local (todo-manager)**:
1. Move `TODO-XXX` from `todos/active/` to current sprint folder (if exists)
2. Update status in `000-master.md`: `Status: IN PROGRESS`
3. Create implementation checklist in `TODO-XXX` file

**GitHub (gh-manager)**:
4. Add comment: `"Started implementation - Sprint X Day Y"`
5. Update labels: Remove `ready-to-start`, add `in-progress`
6. Add to current sprint column in GitHub Project

### Workflow 3: Completing a Story

**Local (todo-manager)**:
1. Move `TODO-XXX` from `todos/active/` to `todos/completed/`
2. Add completion summary to file header:
   ```markdown
   **COMPLETED**: 2025-XX-XX (Sprint X)
   **Achievement Summary**:
   - [Key achievements]
   - [Metrics]
   - [Tests passing]
   - [Story points delivered]
   ```
3. Update `000-master.md`:
   - Mark with ‚úÖ
   - Update completion statistics
   - Update unblocked stories

**GitHub (gh-manager) - COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE REQUIRED**:
4. **Update issue body** (NOT just comments):
   - Mark all completed checklist items with [x]
   - Update status fields in issue description
   - Add "COMPLETED" banner at top of description
   - Update any "Status:" fields to show "COMPLETED"

5. **Fill in all GitHub fields**:
   - Assignees: Add developers who worked on it
   - Labels: Ensure `completed`, `sprint-X`, `phase-X-Y`, priority labels present
   - Remove: `in-progress`, `ready-to-start`, `blocked` labels
   - Milestone: Set to appropriate sprint/release milestone
   - Project: Update project board status to "Done"
   - Linked PRs: Link any related pull requests

6. **Add completion comment** with full template:
   ```markdown
   ## ‚úÖ Story X Completed - Sprint Y

   **Completion Date**: 2025-XX-XX
   **Story Points Delivered**: [N] pts
   **Actual Effort**: [X] days

   ### Achievement Summary
   - [Key achievement 1]
   - [Key achievement 2]
   - [Performance metrics]
   - [Test results]

   ### Files Added/Modified
   - [List of key files]

   ### Unblocked Stories
   This completion unblocks:
   - #YY: Story Y
   - #ZZ: Story Z

   ### Documentation
   - [Link to implementation docs]
   - [Link to test results]
   ```

7. Close issue (only after steps 4-6 complete)

**CRITICAL**: Information must be in issue fields AND body, not just comments!

### Workflow 4: Creating a Sub-Issue

**When to Create Sub-Issues:**
- Implementation tasks within a user story
- Bug fixes related to a story
- Technical debt items within a story
- Enhancements that don't warrant full story

**GitHub (gh-manager)**:
1. Create issue with descriptive title (NOT "Story X" format)
2. Add labels:
   - `parent:story-X` (link to parent)
   - Priority: `p0`, `p1`, `P0-critical`, etc.
   - Type: `enhancement`, `bug`, `tech-debt`
3. Link to parent issue in description:
   ```markdown
   **Parent Story**: #X (Story X: Parent Name)
   ```
4. If has story points, note they're part of parent's total

**Local (todo-manager)**:
5. Add to parent `TODO-XXX` file under "Sub-Tasks" section:
   ```markdown
   ### Sub-Tasks
   - [ ] GitHub Issue #YY: Sub-task name
   ```
6. **Do NOT** create separate TODO file for sub-issues

## üö® Common Sync Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Duplicate Story Numbers
**Problem**: Multiple GitHub issues with same Story number (e.g., two "Story 18" issues)

**Root Cause**:
- Issue created before TODO renumbering
- Issue created with wrong Story number

**Fix**:
1. Identify which is the correct mapping (check `000-master.md`)
2. Close the incorrect issue with comment:
   ```
   Closing as duplicate. This story is tracked in #XX (correct issue).
   ```
3. Add `duplicate` label to closed issue
4. Update correct issue to match TODO file

### Issue 2: TODO-to-Issue Mismatch
**Problem**: TODO-016 in local system maps to Issue #20, but Issue #20 is closed

**Root Cause**:
- Story was redefined/replaced
- Old issue not updated

**Fix**:
1. Check `000-master.md` for correct mapping
2. If story was replaced:
   - Add comment to old issue: `"This story was replaced by TODO-XXX (Issue #YY)"`
   - Close old issue
   - Create new issue for new story
3. Update `000-master.md` with correct mapping

### Issue 3: Sub-Issue Has "Story X" Title
**Problem**: Sub-issue titled "Story 18: Feature" instead of descriptive name

**Root Cause**: Created with wrong naming convention

**Fix**:
1. Rename issue to descriptive title
2. Add `parent:story-X` label
3. Add parent link in description
4. Remove "Story X" format from title

### Issue 4: Missing GitHub Issue Reference
**Problem**: `TODO-XXX` file exists but has `GitHub Issue: #TBD`

**Fix**:
1. Search GitHub for issue with matching story number
2. If exists: Update TODO file with correct issue number
3. If doesn't exist: Create issue following Workflow 1

### Issue 5: Status Mismatch
**Problem**: Local TODO is completed but GitHub issue is open (or vice versa)

**Fix**:
1. Determine correct status (check git history, verify completion)
2. Sync both systems to match correct status
3. If completed: Add completion summary to both
4. If still active: Remove completion marks, reopen issue
