## üöÄ Quick Start Path

### 1. **New to Kailash?** 
Start with [001-installation](001-installation.md) and [002-basic-imports](002-basic-imports.md)

### 2. **Building solutions?** 
See [003-solution-workflow-creation](003-solution-workflow-creation.md) and [004-solution-node-patterns](004-solution-node-patterns.md)

### 3. **Need integrations?** 
Check [005-integration-patterns](005-integration-patterns.md)

### 4. **Ready for production?** 
Review [006-deployment-patterns](006-deployment-patterns.md) and [016-environment-variables](016-environment-variables.md)

## üéØ Solution Development Focus

These cheatsheets are specifically adapted for:
- **Business solution development** (not SDK development)
- **Production deployment** patterns
- **API integration** with existing systems
- **Data pipeline** creation
- **AI/ML integration** for business value
