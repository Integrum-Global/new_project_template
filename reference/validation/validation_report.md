## Key Findings and Updates

### 1. Missing Features in Documentation

The following major features were missing from the reference documentation:

- **Self-Organizing Agent Architecture** (13 specialized nodes)
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication** nodes
- **Intelligent Orchestration** nodes
- **SharePoint Integration** via Microsoft Graph API
- **Access Control Framework** with JWT authentication
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture** support
- **API Gateway** for managing multiple workflows
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** integration
- **Workflow Studio API** backend

### 2. API Pattern Corrections

Several API usage patterns needed correction:

- **Execution Pattern**:
  - ❌ `runtime.execute(workflow, inputs={...})`
  - ✅ `runtime.execute(workflow, parameters={...})`

- **Node Naming**:
  - All node classes should end with "Node" suffix
  - ✅ `CSVReaderNode`, `FilterNode`, `DataTransformerNode`

- **Method Names**:
  - All methods must use snake_case (not camelCase)
  - Configuration keys must use underscores (not camelCase)

### 3. Corrected Method Signatures

Based on the codebase review, the following signatures were verified and documented correctly:

#### Workflow Methods
```python
# Add node - config as kwargs
workflow.add_node(node_id: str, node_or_type: Any, **config) -> None

# Connect nodes - mapping as dict
workflow.connect(source_node: str, target_node: str, mapping: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None) -> None

# Execute directly (returns only results)
workflow.execute(inputs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, task_manager: Optional[TaskManager] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Execute via runtime (returns tuple)
runtime.execute(workflow: Workflow, parameters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], str]
```

### 4. Deprecated Patterns

- **WorkflowBuilder**: Marked as deprecated in favor of direct `Workflow.connect()` usage
- Direct workflow execution without runtime loses tracking and security features

### 5. Security Enhancements

Added comprehensive security documentation:
- SecurityConfig for production deployments
- Path traversal prevention
- Code sandboxing with memory/time limits
- Audit logging capabilities
- SecurityMixin for secure node development

### 6. Modern Architecture Features

Updated documentation to reflect:
- Unified AI provider architecture (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
- Hierarchical RAG implementation with 7 specialized nodes
- Real-time monitoring dashboards with WebSocket streaming
- Performance visualization and reporting
- JWT authentication and RBAC
- Docker and Kubernetes deployment support

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Workflow Execution Pattern
**Previous Documentation (Incorrect):**
```python
workflow.execute(runtime)  # This method signature doesn't exist
```

**Corrected Documentation:**
```python
# Option 1: Execute through runtime (recommended)
runtime = LocalRuntime()
results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow, parameters={...})

# Option 2: Direct execute (limited features)
results = workflow.execute(inputs={...})
```

### 2. Connection Method Signature
**Previous Documentation (Incorrect):**
```python
workflow.connect("from", "to", from_output="port", to_input="port")
```

**Corrected Documentation:**
```python
workflow.connect("source_node", "target_node", mapping={"output_field": "input_field"})
```

### 3. Node Configuration
**Previous Documentation (Incorrect):**
```python
workflow.add_node("id", Node(), config={"param": "value"})
```

**Corrected Documentation:**
```python
workflow.add_node("id", Node(), param="value")  # Config as kwargs
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Update all reference documentation (completed)
2. ⏳ Update pattern-library.md with new workflow patterns
3. ⏳ Sync Sphinx documentation with updated reference files
4. ⏳ Create migration guide for v0.1.3 to v0.1.4

### Future Improvements
1. Add automated validation script to check documentation against code
2. Add doctest to all code examples
3. Create interactive documentation with runnable examples
4. Add performance benchmarks and optimization guides
5. Expand troubleshooting section with common issues
