- [ ] Edge cases validated
- [ ] Data quality validation working

**Integration Testing:**
- [ ] All external API integrations tested
- [ ] Database operations tested with realistic data volumes
- [ ] File processing tested with various file sizes
- [ ] Authentication/authorization flows tested

### ‚úÖ Performance Testing

**Load Testing:**
- [ ] Application handles expected user load
- [ ] Database performs well under concurrent access
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under load
- [ ] Response times within acceptable limits

**Stress Testing:**
- [ ] Application gracefully handles overload
