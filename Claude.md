# Rules for Claude.md

## Project Purpose and Background

## Coding Standards and Conventions

### General Principles

1. **Clean Architecture**: Follow the principles of clean architecture with clear separation of concerns.
2. **Pythonic Style**: Write code that follows Python best practices and idioms.
3. **Type Hints**: Use type hints throughout the codebase to enhance IDE support and documentation.
4. **Documentation**: All classes, methods, and functions must have docstrings.
5. **Error Handling**: Use explicit error handling with descriptive error messages.

### Style Guidelines

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Classes: `PascalCase`
   - Functions/Methods: `snake_case`
   - Variables: `snake_case`
   - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
   - Private attributes/methods: `_leading_underscore`

2. **Code Formatting**:
   - Line length: 88 characters (Black standard)
   - Use spaces, not tabs (4 spaces per indentation level)
   - Follow PEP 8 for other formatting guidelines

3. **Imports**:
   - Group imports in the following order:
     1. Standard library imports
     2. Third-party library imports
     3. Local application imports
   - Sort them according to isort conventions
   - Use absolute imports within the package

## Documentation Requirements

1. **Module Docstrings**: Every module should have a docstring explaining its purpose.
2. **Class Docstrings**: Every class should have a docstring explaining its purpose, behavior, and usage.
3. **Method Docstrings**: Every public method should have a docstring in the following format:
   ```python
   def method(self, arg1, arg2=None):
       """
       Short description of the method.

       Longer description if necessary.

       Args:
           arg1 (type): Description of arg1
           arg2 (type, optional): Description of arg2. Defaults to None.

       Returns:
           type: Description of return value

       Raises:
           ExceptionType: Description of when this exception is raised
       """
   ```

4. **Docstrings must comprehensively include the following**
   - Design purpose and philosophy: Explaining why each component exists
   - Upstream dependencies: What components create/use this class
   - Downstream consumers: What components depend on this class
   - Usage patterns: Common ways the component is used
   - Implementation details: How the component works internally
   - Error handling: What exceptions are raised and when
   - Side effects: Any state changes or external impacts
   - Examples: Concrete usage examples where helpful


## Project Structure

The project structure is recorded in `guide/prd/000-project_structure.md`. Refer to it when necessary.

## Design Principles

1. **Composition Over Inheritance**:
   - Prefer composing functionality over deep inheritance hierarchies
   - Keep inheritance hierarchies shallow (max 2-3 levels)

2. **Single Responsibility Principle**:
   - Each class should have a single responsibility
   - Each module should have a clear, focused purpose

3. **Interface Segregation**:
   - Define clear interfaces through abstract base classes
   - Keep interfaces small and focused

4. **Dependency Inversion**:
   - Depend on abstractions, not concretions
   - Use dependency injection where appropriate

5. **Fail Fast**:
   - Validate inputs early
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Do not silently ignore errors

6. **Clear Component Naming**:
   - Node components MUST include "Node" suffix in their class names
   - Do NOT use aliases that hide the component type (e.g., @register_node(alias="RESTClient"))
   - Users should immediately understand what type of component they're using
   - Examples: RESTClientNode, HTTPRequestNode, GraphQLClientNode (NOT RESTClient, HTTPRequest, etc.)

## Dependencies

Keep dependencies minimal and explicit:

1. **Core Dependencies**:
   - `pydantic`: For data validation and schema definition
   - `pyyaml`: For YAML serialization/deserialization

2. **Optional Dependencies**:
   - `pytest`: For testing
   - `black` and `isort`: For code formatting

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Define custom exception classes in `exceptions.py`
   - Use specific exception types for different error conditions
   - Include context information in exception messages

2. **Configuration**:
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Provide sensible defaults
   - Support configuration overrides

3. **Extensibility**:
   - Design for extension through plugins or custom nodes
   - Document extension points

4. **Node Naming Standards**:
   - ALWAYS use full class names with "Node" suffix for all Node components
   - NEVER create aliases that remove "Node" from the name
   - Bad: `@register_node(alias="HTTPRequest")` for `HTTPRequestNode`
   - Good: `@register_node()` for `HTTPRequestNode`
   - This ensures users always know they're working with a Node component

5. **Performance**:
   - Optimize for developer experience first
   - Address performance bottlenecks as identified

6. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Maintain compatibility with existing Kailash architecture
   - Document any breaking changes clearly

## Must Follow: Code Generation Guidelines

1. **PRD Requirements**
   - Always reference the PRDs in `guide/prd` when generating codes and implementing features.
   - Update the PRD if requirements change during development
   - Link ADRs to relevant sections of the PRD

2. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
   - All significant architectural decisions should be documented using ADRs:
     - **README.md**: Follow the instructions in `guide/adr/README.md` for creating and managing ADRs.
     - **Format**: Follow the ADR template in `guide/adr/`
     - **Numbering**: Use sequential numbering (e.g., ADR-0001)
     - **Status**: Mark each ADR as Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
     - **Summary**: Update or add a summary of ADRs in guide/adr/README.md

3. **Todos Management**:
   - Use the TodoRead and TodoWrite tools to manage active tasks during sessions.
   - **Two-File Todo System** for better Claude Code context management:
     - **Master File**: `guide/todos/000-master.md` - Active tasks and current priorities only
     - **Archive File**: `guide/todos/completed-archive.md` - Complete historical record

   **Master File Structure** (`guide/todos/000-master.md`):
   ```markdown
   # Project Status Overview
   - **Category**: Status - Brief description

   ## ðŸ”¥ URGENT PRIORITY - Current Client Needs
   - **High-impact tasks for active client projects**

   ## High Priority - Active Tasks
   - **Task Name**
     - Description: Clear, actionable description
     - Status: To Do | In Progress | Completed
     - Priority: High | Medium | Low
     - Details: Implementation specifics or context

   ## Medium/Low Priority Tasks
   [Same format as above]

   ## Recent Achievements
   - Brief summary of latest completed work (last 2-3 sessions)
   - Link to completed-archive.md for full history
   ```

   **Archive File Structure** (`guide/todos/completed-archive.md`):
   ```markdown
   # Completed Tasks Archive

   ## Development Sessions History
   ### Session XX (Date) âœ…
   - Detailed breakdown of completed tasks
   - Session statistics and achievements
   - Links to relevant PRs and commits
   ```

   - **Organization Principles**:
     - **Master file**: Focus on current/upcoming work, keep under 300 lines for Claude Code efficiency
     - **Archive file**: Complete historical record for reference and project documentation
     - **Recent achievements**: Brief summary in master, detailed history in archive
     - **Client-driven priorities**: Place urgent client needs at the top of master file
     - **Session documentation**: Record completed work in archive with proper categorization

   - Other todo files in the same directory should record summaries of completed development cycles
   - Always queue these verification tasks at the end of each development cycle:
     - Test examples affected by recent changes
     - Run unit, integration, and documentation tests
     - Verify local GitHub Actions tests pass
     - Update ADRs, todos, and README as needed

4. **Examples**:
   - Always create example nodes and workflows in the `examples/` directory.
   - Always organize examples into categories.
   - Follow naming conventions: `{category}_{description}.py`
   - Ensure examples demonstrate best practices and common usage patterns.
   - Read the `guide/mistakes/000-master.md` file to avoid common pitfalls in examples.
   - **Testing Examples**: Use `examples/_utils/test_all_examples.py` as the entrypoint to test all examples:
     ```bash
     cd examples
     python _utils/test_all_examples.py
     ```
   - This script automatically discovers and validates all example files across all categories
   - Create a basic, simple, and complex examples after each new component is implemented

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Always refer to `guide/mistakes/000-master.md` when troubleshooting issues
     
6. **Unit Tests**:
   - Ensure that examples have been tested and validated before creating unit tests
   - Create unit tests for all components using pytest
   - Maintain >80% code coverage
   - Place tests in a separate `tests/` directory mirroring the package structure
   - Read the `guide/mistakes/000-master.md` file to avoid common pitfalls.

7. **Integration Tests**:
   - Ensure that unit tests have been created for all components before creating integration tests
   - Create integration tests for workflow execution
   - Test export functionality for compatibility with Kailash
   - Read the `guide/mistakes/000-master.md` file to avoid common pitfalls.

8. **Sphinx Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation framework in `docs/`
   - Build with: `cd docs && python build_docs.py`
   - Auto-deployed via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages
   - All public APIs must have comprehensive docstrings with examples
   - Use Napoleon with Google-style for docstrings
   - Uses ReStructuredText (reST) format for Sphinx compatibility, which means that code blocks must be preceded by :: followed by a newline, and indentation must be consistent.

9. **Documentation Tests**:
   - Include examples in docstrings that can be verified with doctest

10. **Mistakes**: Record all coding mistakes in `guide/mistakes/000-master.md`
    - Include:
      - Description of the mistake
      - Code example that caused the issue
      - Solution or fix applied

11. **Update README.md**:
    - Overview of the project
    - Installation instructions
    - Quick start guide
    - Usage examples
    - API reference
    - Contribution guidelines
    - Reference to the PRD and ADRs

12. **Update ADRs**:
    - Ensure all architectural decisions are documented in the ADRs.
    - Link relevant ADRs to the PRD and README.md.
    - Update ADRs as new decisions are made or existing ones are modified.

13. **Update Claude.md**:
    - If there are any changes to the coding standards, conventions, or design principles, update the Claude.md file accordingly.
    - Update the project structure if there are any changes to the directory layout or file organization.

14. ** Update CHANGELOG.md**:
    - Record all changes made in the current development cycle.
    - Include:
      - New features
      - Bug fixes
      - Improvements
      - Breaking changes
    - Use a clear and consistent format for each entry.
    
15. **Pre-commit Hooks and Code Quality**:
    - **Pre-commit Setup**: Use automated pre-commit hooks to enforce coding standards
    - **Automated Hooks Configuration** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`):
      - **Black**: Code formatting (88 character line length)
      - **isort**: Import sorting (Black-compatible profile)
      - **Ruff**: Fast Python linting with auto-fixes
      - **pytest**: Unit tests (subset for speed)
      - **Trivy**: Security vulnerability scanning
      - **detect-secrets**: Secret detection with baseline
      - **doc8**: Documentation linting
      - **mypy**: Type checking
      - **Built-in checks**: Whitespace, file endings, syntax validation
    - **Development Workflow**:
      - Hooks run automatically on every commit
      - Failed hooks prevent commits (encourages fixing issues immediately)
      - Manual formatting commands still available when needed
      - See `guide/development/pre-commit-hooks.md` for comprehensive documentation

16. **Github Actions**:
    - Use Github Actions for continuous integration.
    - Test locally before pushing changes.

17. **Github Issues and Project Update**:
    - Use the Github Issues and Projects to track tasks and progress.
    - Create issues for each task in the Todo list, describing the task and linking to the relevant ADR or PRD.
    - Update the project board as tasks are completed.

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
