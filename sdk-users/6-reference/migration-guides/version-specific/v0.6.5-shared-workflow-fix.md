# Kailash SDK v0.6.5+ Migration Guide - Shared Workflow Fix

## Overview

Version 0.6.5+ includes a critical fix for AgentUIMiddleware shared workflow execution. This guide covers the changes and any migration steps needed.

## Key Changes

### 1. Shared Workflow Execution Fix

**Issue**: Previously, workflows registered with `make_shared=True` could not be executed from sessions, resulting in "Workflow not found in session" errors.

**Fix**: Shared workflows are now automatically copied to sessions when first executed.

#### Before (Required Workaround)
```python
# Register shared workflow
await agent_ui.register_workflow("auth", workflow, make_shared=True)

# Manual workaround was needed
session = await agent_ui.get_session(session_id)
if "auth" not in session.workflows:
    session.add_workflow("auth", agent_ui.shared_workflows["auth"])

# Then execute
execution_id = await agent_ui.execute(session_id, "auth", inputs)
```

#### After (Works Automatically)
```python
# Register shared workflow
await agent_ui.register_workflow("auth", workflow, make_shared=True)

# Execute directly - workflow is automatically copied to session
execution_id = await agent_ui.execute(session_id, "auth", inputs)
```

### 2. Execute Method Standardization

The `execute_workflow()` method is deprecated in favor of `execute()` for consistency with runtime API.

#### Before
```python
execution_id = await agent_ui.execute_workflow(
    session_id=session_id,
    workflow_id=workflow_id,
    parameters={"data": "value"}
)
```

#### After
```python
execution_id = await agent_ui.execute(
    session_id=session_id,
    workflow_id=workflow_id,
    parameters={"data": "value"}
)
```

## Migration Steps

### For Shared Workflows

1. **Remove Manual Workarounds**: If you have code that manually copies shared workflows to sessions, it can be removed.

2. **Test Shared Workflow Execution**: Verify your shared workflows execute correctly without manual intervention.

### For Execute Method

1. **Update Method Calls**: Replace all calls to `execute_workflow()` with `execute()`.

2. **Update Import Statements**: No changes needed - the method is on the same class.

## Behavior Notes

### Shared Workflow Priority
- Session-specific workflows take priority over shared workflows with the same ID
- If a session has a workflow with ID "processor" and a shared workflow exists with the same ID, the session-specific one is used

### Session Isolation
- Each session gets its own copy of the shared workflow when first executed
- Execution state is maintained separately per session
- Workflows are stateless, so sharing the definition is safe

### Best Practices
- Use shared workflows for common processing patterns used across multiple sessions
- Use session-specific workflows for customized or user-specific logic
- Consider workflow naming conventions to avoid ID conflicts

## Testing

Verify shared workflow functionality:

```python
import asyncio
from kailash.middleware.core.agent_ui import AgentUIMiddleware
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder

async def test_shared_workflows():
    middleware = AgentUIMiddleware()

    # Create workflow
    builder = WorkflowBuilder()
    builder.add_node("PythonCodeNode", "processor", {
        "code": "result = {'processed': True}"
    })
    workflow = builder.build()

    # Register as shared
    await middleware.register_workflow("shared_proc", workflow, make_shared=True)

    # Create sessions and execute
    session1 = await middleware.create_session()
    session2 = await middleware.create_session()

    # Both should work without manual copying
    exec1 = await middleware.execute(session1, "shared_proc", {})
    exec2 = await middleware.execute(session2, "shared_proc", {})

    print(f"Session 1 execution: {exec1}")
    print(f"Session 2 execution: {exec2}")

asyncio.run(test_shared_workflows())
```

## Version Compatibility

- **Affected Versions**: All versions prior to 0.6.5
- **Fixed Version**: 0.6.5+
- **Backward Compatibility**: Full - existing workarounds continue to work but are no longer needed
