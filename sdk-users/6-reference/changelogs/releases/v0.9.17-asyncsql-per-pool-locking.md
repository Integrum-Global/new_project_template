# v0.9.17 - AsyncSQL Per-Pool Locking Performance Release

**Release Date**: TBD  
**Type**: Performance & Reliability Enhancement

## Overview

Major performance improvements to AsyncSQLDatabaseNode eliminating lock contention bottlenecks in high-concurrency scenarios. This release introduces per-pool locking architecture, achieving 100% success rates at 300+ concurrent workflows.

## Breaking Changes

### AsyncSQL Pool Locking Architecture

**Previous Behavior (v0.9.15 and earlier):**
- Single global lock serialized all pool operations
- 40-50% failure rate at 200-300 concurrent workflows
- All database pools blocked each other

**New Behavior (v0.9.16+):**
- Per-pool locking allows concurrent operations on different pools
- Same pool operations remain safely serialized
- 100% success rate at 300+ concurrent workflows
- Event loop isolation prevents cross-loop interference

**Migration Impact:**
- **No API changes** - all existing code works unchanged
- **Performance improvements** - applications will see better concurrency
- **SQLite memory database behavior** - named memory databases (`:memory:name`) are shared at engine level (expected SQLite behavior)

## Added

### Core Performance Improvements
- ✅ **Per-Pool Locking Architecture**: Each unique pool configuration gets its own `asyncio.Lock`
- ✅ **Event Loop Isolation**: Lock registries isolated per event loop to prevent interference
- ✅ **Deadlock Prevention**: 5-second timeout on all lock acquisitions with fallback mechanism
- ✅ **Memory Leak Protection**: Automatic cleanup of unused locks via `_cleanup_unused_locks()`
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for lock acquisition/release/timeout events

### New Methods and APIs
- ✅ **`_get_pool_creation_lock(pool_key)`**: Returns per-pool `asyncio.Lock` for given pool key
- ✅ **`_acquire_pool_lock_with_timeout(pool_key, timeout)`**: Context manager with timeout protection
- ✅ **`get_lock_metrics()`**: Exposes lock statistics including acquisition count, wait times, timeout events
- ✅ **`_cleanup_unused_locks()`**: Manual cleanup method for long-running applications

### Enhanced Diagnostics
- ✅ **Lock Metrics**: Real-time statistics on lock usage and contention
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Detailed lock lifecycle events for troubleshooting
- ✅ **Pool Information**: Enhanced pool info including lock states

## Changed

### Performance Optimizations
- ⚡ **Concurrent Pool Operations**: Different pools no longer block each other
- ⚡ **Reduced Lock Wait Times**: Average wait times decreased from seconds to milliseconds
- ⚡ **Higher Success Rates**: 300+ concurrent workflows achieve 100% success (vs 50-60% previously)
- ⚡ **Better Resource Utilization**: Improved CPU and memory efficiency under load

### Internal Architecture
- 🔧 **Lock Registry**: `_pool_locks_by_loop` maps event loops to pool-specific locks
- 🔧 **Thread Safety**: `_pool_locks_mutex` ensures thread-safe access to lock registry
- 🔧 **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful degradation to dedicated pools on lock timeout
- 🔧 **Cleanup Strategy**: Proactive cleanup prevents memory leaks in long-running applications

## Fixed

### High-Concurrency Issues
- 🐛 **Lock Contention Bottleneck**: Eliminated global lock causing 40-50% failures
- 🐛 **Performance Degradation**: Resolved serialization of independent pool operations  
- 🐛 **Timeout Errors**: Reduced timeout events through better lock granularity
- 🐛 **Memory Leaks**: Added cleanup mechanisms for unused locks

### Edge Cases
- 🐛 **Event Loop Conflicts**: Isolated lock registries prevent cross-loop interference
- 🐛 **Deadlock Scenarios**: Timeout mechanisms prevent indefinite lock waiting
- 🐛 **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup during node disconnection and pool destruction

## Documentation

## Migration Guide

### Existing Applications
Most applications require **no changes** and will automatically benefit from performance improvements.

### High-Load Applications
Consider these optimizations for applications with >100 concurrent workflows:

```python
# Optimal configuration for high concurrency
node = AsyncSQLDatabaseNode(
    database_type="postgresql",
    pool_size=10,           # Increased from default 5
    max_pool_size=50,       # Increased from default 20
    timeout=30.0,           # Generous timeout for complex queries
    share_pool=True,        # Enable per-pool locking benefits
)

# Enable debug logging for monitoring
import logging
logging.getLogger('kailash.nodes.data.async_sql').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Monitor lock metrics
metrics = AsyncSQLDatabaseNode.get_lock_metrics()
print(f"Lock success rate: {metrics.get('success_rate', 0):.1%}")
```

### Legacy Fallback
If issues arise, temporary fallback to legacy behavior:

```python
import os
os.environ['KAILASH_USE_LEGACY_POOL_LOCKING'] = 'true'
```

**Note**: Legacy mode is deprecated and will be removed in v0.10.0.

## Future Plans

### v0.9.17 (Next Release)
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Advanced lock monitoring dashboard
- Automatic lock tuning based on load patterns

### v0.10.0 (Breaking Changes)
- Remove legacy global locking fallback
- Enhanced connection pool management
- Advanced concurrency controls

## Testing

This release includes comprehensive test coverage:
- **27 TDD Unit Tests**: Cover all per-pool locking scenarios  
- **5 PostgreSQL Integration Tests**: Real database testing with Docker
- **3 E2E Concurrency Tests**: 100/200/300 workflow load testing
- **Deadlock Prevention Tests**: Timeout and recovery scenarios
- **Memory Leak Tests**: Long-running cleanup validation

All tests pass with 100% success rate across Python 3.9-3.12.
