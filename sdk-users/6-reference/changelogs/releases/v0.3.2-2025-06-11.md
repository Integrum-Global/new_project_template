# [0.3.2] - 2025-06-11

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: PythonCodeNode Output Validation Consistency** - Framework-level fix
  - All PythonCodeNode outputs now consistently wrapped in `"result"` key
  - Functions returning dicts no longer cause "Required output 'result' not provided" errors
  - Both dict and non-dict function returns work identically
  - Manufacturing workflows (IoT, Quality Control, Supply Chain, Production Planning) now execute successfully
  - Updated core implementation in `/src/kailash/nodes/code/python.py`

### Added
- **Complete Manufacturing Workflow Library** - Production-ready industrial workflows
  - IoT Sensor Processing - Real-time anomaly detection and predictive maintenance
  - Quality Control - Six Sigma statistical process control with control charts
  - Supply Chain Optimization - EOQ calculations and supplier performance management
  - Production Planning - Capacity analysis and schedule optimization
  - All workflows use real manufacturing data and industry-standard algorithms

### Documentation
- **Updated PythonCodeNode Documentation** - Reflects output consistency changes
  - Added "Output Handling (Framework Update)" section to developer guide
  - Updated troubleshooting guide with Session 064 fix details
  - Updated CLAUDE.md critical validation rules
  - Created comprehensive mistake documentation (078-pythoncode-output-validation-consistency-fix.md)

### Testing
- All core PythonCodeNode tests pass (33/33)
- All manufacturing workflows execute end-to-end successfully
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing workflows
