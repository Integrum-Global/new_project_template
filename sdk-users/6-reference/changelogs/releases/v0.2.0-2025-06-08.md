# [0.2.0] - 2025-06-08

### Added
- **Universal Hybrid Cyclic Graph Architecture** - Phase 6 Complete
  - `CycleAwareNode` base class with comprehensive helper methods:
    - `get_iteration()` - Track current iteration number
    - `get_previous_state()` - Access state from previous iteration
    - `set_cycle_state()` - Persist state across iterations
    - `accumulate_values()` - Build rolling windows of values
    - `detect_convergence_trend()` - Automatic convergence detection
    - `log_cycle_info()` - Structured logging for cycles
  - Cyclic workflow execution support in `Workflow.connect()`:
    - `# Use CycleBuilder API instead` parameter to mark cyclic edges
    - `max_iterations` for safety limits
    - `convergence_check` for dynamic stopping conditions
  - `CyclicWorkflowExecutor` for optimized cyclic execution
  - `ParallelCyclicRuntime` for parallel execution of cycles
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 15+ integration tests
  - Performance optimizations achieving ~30,000 iterations/second
  - Built-in cycle detection and validation
  - State management with automatic cleanup
  - Support for nested cycles and multi-node cycles

- **Developer Tools & Analytics**
  - `CycleAnalyzer` for comprehensive cycle performance analysis
  - `CycleDebugger` for interactive debugging of cyclic workflows
  - `CycleProfiler` for detailed performance profiling
  - `CycleBuilder` with fluent API for constructing cyclic workflows
  - Type-safe configuration with `CycleConfig` and `TypedCycleConfig`
  - Advanced exception handling with specialized cycle exceptions
  - Developer-focused helper methods and productivity tools

- **Production-Ready Features**
  - Enhanced PythonCodeNode with better DataFrame and NumPy support
  - Automatic serialization handling for complex data types
  - Platform-specific type compatibility checks
  - Memory-efficient data processing patterns
  - Production-ready error handling and recovery

- **Enhanced Database Connectivity**
  - SQLDatabaseNode with direct constructor configuration
  - Support for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL
  - Production-ready connection pooling and transaction management

### Changed
- Enhanced `LocalRuntime` to automatically detect and route cyclic workflows
- Improved workflow validation to handle cyclic graphs correctly
- Updated execution engine to support iterative processing patterns
- Improved PythonCodeNode error messages and debugging support
- Enhanced cycle parameter propagation and state management

### Performance
- Cyclic workflows execute with minimal overhead (~0.03ms per iteration)
- Memory-efficient state management with configurable history windows
- Optimized convergence detection algorithms
- Parallel execution support for independent cycle branches
- Production-tested with workflows handling 100,000+ iterations
