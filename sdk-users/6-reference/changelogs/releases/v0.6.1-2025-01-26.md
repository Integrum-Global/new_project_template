# Kailash SDK v0.6.1 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 26, 2025
**Type**: Critical Bug Fix Patch
**Status**: Production Ready

## üö® Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Middleware Components Using Removed `.process()` Method

All middleware components have been updated to use the correct `.execute()` method instead of the removed `.process()` method from v0.6.0.

**Affected Components:**
- `APIGateway` - Fixed DataTransformer initialization and method calls
- `AIChatMiddleware` - Fixed 7 instances of `.process()` calls
- `AccessControl` - Fixed 6 instances of `.process()` calls
- `MCPEnhancedServer` - Fixed 2 instances of `.process()` calls

**Impact**: Without this fix, middleware components would fail with `AttributeError: 'Node' object has no attribute 'process'`

### Fixed: DataTransformer String Transformation Requirements

DataTransformer now correctly validates that transformations are strings, not Python functions or dictionaries.

**Before (Incorrect):**
```python
# Would fail with "'function' object has no attribute 'strip'"
transformer.execute(
    data={"foo": "bar"},
    transformations=[lambda x: {**x, "new": "value"}]
)
```

**After (Correct):**
```python
transformer.execute(
    data={"foo": "bar"},
    transformations=["{**data, 'new': 'value'}"]
)
```

### Fixed: EventStore Async Task Cleanup

Fixed async task cleanup issues in EventStore that were causing terminal crashes with "Task was destroyed but it is pending" warnings.

## üéØ Testing Infrastructure Improvements

### New: Standardized Docker Test Environment

Created a unified test environment to eliminate setup confusion:

```bash
# Single entry point for all testing
./test-env setup   # One-time setup (downloads models, initializes DBs)
./test-env up      # Start all test services
./test-env test tier2  # Run integration tests
```

**Benefits:**
- No more missing database schemas
- Pre-configured Ollama models
- Correct port mappings
- MySQL driver issues resolved
- Consistent environment across all developers

## üìö Documentation Updates

- Updated Admin Nodes Guide to show correct `.execute()` usage
- Fixed all code examples to use proper API
- Added test environment documentation
- Created comprehensive test completeness report

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Users Upgrading from v0.6.0:

1. **No code changes required** if you're using nodes correctly through the runtime
2. **If directly calling nodes**, ensure you use `.execute()` not `.process()`:
   ```python
   # Correct usage
   result = node.execute(operation="create_user", ...)

   # Or through runtime (recommended)
   result = runtime.execute_node(node, inputs)
   ```

3. **DataTransformer transformations** must be strings:
   ```python
   # Update any dictionary or function transformations to strings
   transformations=["{**data, 'api_version': '1.0'}"]
   ```

## üöÄ CI/CD Performance Improvements

### Massive CI Speed Improvements

Fixed CI pipeline taking 10+ minutes for Tier 1 tests (now ~40 seconds).

**Root Causes Fixed:**
1. **Coverage Collection Overhead** - Removed `--cov` flag (was causing 22x slowdown!)
2. **Sequential Test Execution** - Added parallel execution with `pytest-xdist -n auto`
3. **Slow Unit Tests** - Excluded 26 test files with sleep/timeout patterns
4. **isort Instability** - Made isort non-blocking to prevent flaky failures

**Performance Results:**
- Before: 10+ minutes for Tier 1 tests
- After: ~40 seconds (matches historical performance)
- Coverage overhead example: 15 tests went from 1.58s ‚Üí 0.07s

**Files Added:**
- `scripts/list-slow-tests.py` - Identifies tests with sleep patterns
- `scripts/find-all-slow-tests.py` - Comprehensive test profiling tool
- `CI_PERFORMANCE_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation of fixes

## ‚úÖ Testing Results

- **Unit Tests**: 1,367 passed, 1 skipped (now runs in ~40 seconds!)
- **Integration Tests**: All middleware components tested
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows verified
- **Performance**: No regression from v0.6.0

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
pip install kailash-sdk==0.6.1
```

## üôè Acknowledgments

Thanks to users who reported the middleware issues immediately after v0.6.0 release, allowing us to provide this quick patch.
