# Research and Design Instructions
1. I want you to deep dive into the following parts of <solution>:
   - Insert the features, functionalities, outcomes, deliverables, that you want
   - Give some rationale like <there must be a reason why they are not doing this> or
   - <we must be missing most of the nuanced features that makes them a production quality solution>.
   - The solution is in here <local repository path>.
2. Look into our SDK deeply as well, sdk-users/ is a good starting point.
   - Understand our philosophy and design principles.
   - Understand our architecture and how it differs from the solution you are analyzing.
   - Understand our components and how they are designed to work together.
   - Understand our SDK and how it is intended to be used.
   - Understand our use-cases and how they are implemented.
   - Understand our user flows and how they are designed to be intuitive and efficient.
3. Critique the solution's appproach
   - I do not want to blindy adopt it because our SDK is fundamentally different in philosophy and design.
   - I want you to do another deep-dive (including web search on technical information)
     - uncover the latest and most advanced, efficient and performant approaches to enterprise production quality that fits our SDK better.
   - I want to put together the best-in-class of the various components that will fit and optimize our SDK like a glove, without the weaknesses due to different philosophy and design.
4. Document your findings in sdk-contributors/core-sdk-improvements/
   - Use multiple files if you have to, and be very detailed.
