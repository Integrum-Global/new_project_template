# RDF Process: Instruction Snippets for Claude Code

*Choose the right instruction snippet to guide Claude Code through your implementation*

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Selection Guide

| Your Task | Characteristics | Copy-Paste File                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bug Fix** | < 4 hours, < 20 lines changed, existing functionality | [snippets/bug-fix.md](snippets/bug-fix.md)                                       |
| **Feature Addition** | Any new functionality, from simple to complex | [snippets/.../feature-implementation.md](snippets/.../feature-implementation.md) |

## ðŸ“‹ How to Use

1. **Choose your snippet** based on the task complexity above
2. **Copy the entire instruction** from the appropriate file
3. **Paste to Claude Code** to start the implementation
4. **Use contextual snippets** when specific issues arise during implementation

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Tips

- **Start with the right snippet** - Use bug-fix for fixes, feature-implementation for anything new
- **Copy complete instructions** - Don't cherry-pick partial sections
- **Wait for validation** - Don't proceed until Claude Code shows outputs
- **Be thorough** - These instructions are comprehensive to prevent Claude Code failures
- **Follow instructions completely** - Both snippets have comprehensive guidance for all scenarios

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

When Claude Code follows these instructions, you should get:
- âœ… Complete implementations (no missing pieces)
- âœ… Working tests (actually verified)
- âœ… Correct code (no wrong rewrites)
- âœ… Learning from feedback (no repeated mistakes)
