## 🚀 Quick Reference

### Essential Patterns

**Basic Agent Creation:**
```python
import kaizen
framework = kaizen.Kaizen(signature_programming_enabled=True)
agent = framework.create_agent("analyzer", signature="text -> summary")
```

**Enterprise Configuration:**
```python
config = kaizen.KaizenConfig(
    memory_enabled=True,
    audit_trail_enabled=True,
    security_level="high"
)
framework = kaizen.Kaizen(config=config)
```

**Multi-Agent Coordination:**
```python
team = framework.create_agent_team(
    "analysis_team",
    pattern="collaborative",
    roles=["researcher", "analyst", "reviewer"]
)
```

**MCP Tool Exposure:**
```python
framework.expose_agent_as_mcp_tool(
    agent=search_agent,
    tool_name="enterprise_search",
    description="AI-powered search"
)
```

### Core SDK Integration
Always remember the essential pattern:
```python
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime
runtime = LocalRuntime()
workflow = agent.to_workflow()
results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow.build())
```

## 🔗 Integration with Kailash Ecosystem

### Core SDK Foundation
- **Built ON Core SDK**: Kaizen extends Core SDK patterns
