### Changed
- **Architecture Refactoring**: Complete migration from monolithic gateway to composable middleware components
- **Test Infrastructure**: Updated GitHub Actions CI to exclude slow tests for faster builds
- **Documentation Structure**: Enhanced developer guides with middleware integration patterns
- **API Design**: Shifted to middleware-first approach for all production deployments

### Fixed
- **Gateway Integration**: Resolved all integration test failures after middleware refactoring
- **CI Performance**: Eliminated timeout issues by properly marking and excluding slow tests
- **Test Reliability**: Achieved consistent 100% pass rate across all test categories

### Documentation
- **Middleware Integration Guide**: Comprehensive guide for building production applications with middleware
- **Updated README**: Added v0.4.0 middleware architecture section with code examples
- **Test Documentation**: Updated to reflect gateway test refactoring and new middleware testing patterns
- **API Documentation**: Enhanced with middleware component specifications

### Breaking Changes
- **Gateway API**: Old monolithic gateway replaced with composable middleware - migration required
- **Import Paths**: Middleware components now imported from `kailash.middleware` instead of `kailash.api`
- **Test Structure**: Gateway tests migrated to new middleware integration patterns

### Migration
- See [Middleware Integration Guide](sdk-users/developer/16-middleware-integration-guide.md) for migration instructions
- Update imports from `kailash.api` to `kailash.middleware` for gateway functionality
- Replace direct gateway usage with AgentUIMiddleware and APIGateway combination

### Performance
- **Real-time Communication**: Sub-200ms latency for WebSocket/SSE updates
- **Session Management**: Supports 1000+ concurrent sessions with automatic cleanup
- **Database Operations**: Connection pooling and optimized query patterns
- **Test Execution**: CI builds complete in <2 minutes (previously >5 minutes)

### Added
- **Critical SDK Enhancements** (Session 067) - Real-world usage improvements
  - Workflow Resilience Features: Integrated retry policies, circuit breakers, and fallback patterns into standard Workflow
    - Multiple retry strategies (immediate, linear, exponential, Fibonacci)
    - Circuit breaker pattern with configurable thresholds
    - Dead letter queue for failed executions
    - No separate ResilientWorkflow class needed - features available via decorator
  - CredentialManagerNode: Enterprise credential management with multi-source support
    - Supports env, file, vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
    - Built-in validation for API keys, OAuth2, database, certificates
    - Automatic credential masking in logs
    - Caching with configurable TTL
  - SharePointGraphReaderEnhanced: Multiple authentication methods
    - Certificate-based authentication (most secure)
    - Username/password (legacy support)
    - Managed Identity (Azure-hosted apps)
    - Device code flow (CLI tools)
    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing SharePointGraphReader

- **Admin Tool Framework** (Session 066) - Complete enterprise admin infrastructure
  - Core Admin Nodes: UserManagementNode, RoleManagementNode, PermissionCheckNode, AuditLogNode, SecurityEventNode
  - Admin Workflows: User onboarding, permission assignment, audit trail patterns
  - React UI Components: 7 admin interfaces with TypeScript (UserManagement, RoleManagement, AuditLogs, SecurityDashboard, PermissionMatrix, TenantManagement, AdminLayout)
  - QA Testing Framework: 4 comprehensive QA agents (strategic planning, interactive testing, chaos testing, unified orchestration)
  - Full integration with Session 065's async database and ABAC infrastructure
  - Production architecture documentation explaining distributed vs monolithic deployment

- **Async Database Infrastructure** (Session 065) - Enterprise-grade async database support

  - Composition-based architecture for better testability and flexibility
  - Fixed circular import issues and security vulnerabilities
  - Backward compatible helper functions: `create_attribute_condition()`, `create_complex_condition()`
  - All 16 ABAC operators preserved with data masking capabilities

### Changed
- **Access Control Refactoring** - Unified all access control under single interface
  - Removed `EnhancedAccessControlManager` - use `AccessControlManager` instead
