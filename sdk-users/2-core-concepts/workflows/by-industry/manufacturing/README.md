## Data Requirements

All workflows use real manufacturing data located in `/data/inputs/manufacturing/`:

- `sensor_readings.csv` - IoT sensor data with timestamps and readings
- `production_metrics.csv` - Production line performance data
- `inventory_levels.csv` - Current inventory levels and parameters
- `supplier_performance.csv` - Supplier delivery and quality metrics
- `machine_schedule.csv` - Production schedules and machine assignments

## Key Features

### Production-Ready Patterns
- **Real Data Integration**: All workflows use actual manufacturing data, not mock data
- **Statistical Rigor**: Proper statistical methods (Six Sigma, EOQ, control charts)
- **Business Logic**: Implements actual manufacturing best practices
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for production environments

### Modern Code Patterns
- **Function-Based Processing**: Uses `PythonCodeNode.from_function()` for complex logic
- **Centralized Data Management**: Proper data path utilities
- **Type Safety**: Proper data type conversions and validation
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns and reusable functions

### Industrial Standards
- **Six Sigma Quality Control**: Statistical process control with proper control limits
- **Economic Order Quantity**: Scientifically-based inventory optimization
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Multi-factor equipment health assessment
- **Lean Manufacturing**: Focus on waste reduction and efficiency optimization

These provide wrong→correct pattern examples for LLM training, covering:
- Common mistakes in manufacturing workflow development
- Best practices for sensor data processing
- Proper statistical analysis techniques
- Production-ready error handling patterns

## Integration Examples

### With Existing Systems
- **ERP Integration**: Connect to SAP, Oracle, or other ERP systems
- **MES Integration**: Interface with Manufacturing Execution Systems
- **SCADA Integration**: Real-time data from supervisory control systems
- **Quality Management**: Integration with quality management software

### API Endpoints
All workflows can be exposed as REST APIs using the Kailash workflow API wrapper:

```python
from kailash.api.workflow_api import WorkflowAPI

# Expose IoT sensor processing as API
api = WorkflowAPI()
api.add_workflow("iot-sensor-processing", iot_workflow)
api.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

```

## Performance Considerations

- **Real-time Processing**: IoT workflow designed for sub-second response times
- **Batch Processing**: Quality control optimized for daily/shift-based analysis
- **Scalability**: All workflows support horizontal scaling
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized for large datasets typical in manufacturing

## Getting Started

1. **Ensure Data Availability**: Verify manufacturing data files exist in `/data/inputs/manufacturing/`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all required Python packages are installed
3. **Configure Paths**: Verify data path utilities point to correct directories
4. **Run Workflows**: Execute individual workflows or integrate into larger systems
5. **Review Outputs**: Check results in `/data/outputs/manufacturing/`

## Best Practices

- Use real production data whenever possible
- Implement proper error handling for sensor failures
- Follow statistical best practices for quality control
- Integrate with existing manufacturing systems
- Monitor workflow performance and optimize as needed
- Document any customizations for your specific manufacturing environment
