## Implementation Examples

### Portfolio Analysis Example
```python
from kailash_workflows.investment import create_portfolio_analysis_workflow
from kailash.runtime import AsyncLocalRuntime

# Create workflow
workflow = create_portfolio_analysis_workflow()

# Configure for your environment
workflow.configure({
    "database": {
        "main": "postgresql://user:pass@host/db",
        "vector": "postgresql://user:pass@host/vectordb"
    },
    "ai_model": "gpt-4",
    "security": {
        "rbac": True,
        "abac": True,
        "attributes": ["department", "security_clearance"]
    }
})

# Execute analysis
runtime = AsyncLocalRuntime(max_concurrency=50)
results = await runtime.execute(workflow, {
    "portfolio_id": "PORT123",
    "analysis_date": "2024-01-15",
    "include_benchmarks": True,
    "include_stress_tests": True
})

# Results include:
# - risk_metrics: VaR, volatility, Sharpe ratio
# - performance_metrics: returns, attribution
# - ai_insights: recommendations and observations
# - report_url: generated report location

```

### Deal Sourcing Example
```python
from kailash_workflows.investment import create_deal_sourcing_workflow

workflow = create_deal_sourcing_workflow()

results = await runtime.execute(workflow.build(), {
    "deal_documents": ["pitch_deck.pdf", "financials.xlsx"],
    "deal_metadata": {
        "company": "TechStartup Inc",
        "sector": "SaaS",
        "stage": "Series B",
        "target_size": 50000000
    },
    "analysis_depth": "comprehensive"
})

# Results include:
# - deal_score: AI-generated score (0-100)
# - similar_deals: comparable transactions
# - risk_factors: identified risks
# - due_diligence_items: checklist

```

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Async-First Design
All workflows use async operations for optimal performance:
- Non-blocking database queries
- Concurrent API calls
- Parallel processing
- Connection pooling

### 2. Domain-Driven Structure
Workflows organized by business domain:
```
investment/
├── schemas.py          # Domain models
├── nodes.py           # Custom nodes
├── portfolio.py       # Portfolio workflows
├── risk.py           # Risk workflows
└── compliance.py     # Compliance workflows
```

### 3. Security Integration
Built-in security at every level:
- RBAC for role-based access
- ABAC for attribute-based control
- Data masking capabilities
- Audit logging

### 4. Performance Optimization
Designed for enterprise scale:
- 500+ concurrent users
- Sub-200ms response times
- Efficient resource usage
- Horizontal scalability

## Configuration

### Database Connections
```python
CONNECTION_POOLS = {
    "main": {
        "min_connections": 10,
        "max_connections": 50,
        "timeout": 30
    },
    "analytics": {
        "min_connections": 5,
        "max_connections": 20,
        "timeout": 60
    },
    "vector": {
        "min_connections": 5,
        "max_connections": 30,
        "timeout": 30
    }
}

```

### AI Model Selection
```python
AI_MODELS = {
    "analysis": "gpt-4",
    "summarization": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "embedding": "text-embedding-3-large",
    "classification": "claude-3-opus"
}

```

### Caching Strategy
```python
CACHE_CONFIG = {
    "portfolio_data": {"ttl": 300},      # 5 minutes
    "market_data": {"ttl": 60},          # 1 minute
    "research": {"ttl": 3600},           # 1 hour
    "compliance": {"ttl": 86400}         # 24 hours
}

```
