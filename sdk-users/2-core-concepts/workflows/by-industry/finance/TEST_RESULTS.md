# Finance Workflows Test Results

**Test Date**: June 11, 2025
**Status**: ✅ All workflows passed

## Test Summary

| Workflow | Status | Output File | Key Results |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Credit Risk Assessment | ✅ Success | `credit_risk_reports.json` | 5 customers analyzed, all low risk |
| Fraud Detection | ✅ Success | `fraud_detection_report.json` | 8 transactions, 0 high risk detected |
| Portfolio Optimization | ✅ Success | `portfolio_optimization_report.json` | 4 rebalancing trades, $22k rebalance |
| Trading Signals | ✅ Success | `trading_signals_report.json` | 5 signals generated, bearish market |
| Simple Credit Risk | ✅ Success | `simple_credit_risk_report.json` | 8 customers, 3 high risk |

## Key Observations

1. **Data Generation**: All workflows successfully handle missing data by generating appropriate sample datasets
2. **Error Handling**: No runtime errors encountered
3. **Output Quality**: All JSON reports generated successfully with proper structure
4. **Performance**: All workflows completed in under 1 second
5. **AI Integration**: LLMAgentNode properly handles empty/mock responses

## Technical Notes

- Optional visualization dependencies (plotly, seaborn) warnings don't affect core functionality
- All workflows use `PythonCodeNode.from_function()` pattern as required
- Proper data path management using centralized utilities
- JSON serialization working correctly for all data types

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Each workflow runs independently without errors
2. ✅ Output files are created in correct locations
3. ✅ Data processing logic executes correctly
4. ✅ AI nodes handle responses gracefully
5. ✅ Risk calculations produce reasonable results

## Next Steps

- Consider adding integration tests for workflow combinations
- Implement performance benchmarks for larger datasets
- Add data validation schemas for inputs/outputs
