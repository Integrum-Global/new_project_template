## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install kailash pandas numpy
```

2. **Prepare data files** (or use auto-generated sample data):
```bash
# Create data directories
mkdir -p data/inputs/finance
mkdir -p data/outputs/json

# Copy your data files or let workflows generate samples
```

3. **Run a workflow**:
```bash
python scripts/credit_risk_assessment.py
python scripts/fraud_detection.py
python scripts/portfolio_optimization.py
python scripts/trading_signals.py
python scripts/credit_risk_simple.py
python scripts/portfolio_analysis_with_connection_pool.py  # Requires PostgreSQL
```

## Output Structure

All workflows generate structured JSON reports in `data/outputs/json/`:
- `credit_risk_reports.json`: Credit assessment results
- `fraud_detection_report.json`: Fraud alerts and analysis
- `portfolio_optimization_report.json`: Rebalancing recommendations
- `trading_signals_report.json`: Trading alerts and market analysis
- `credit_risk_report.json`: Simple risk assessment

## Common Patterns

### 1. Using from_function Pattern
```python
# SDK Setup for example
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime
from kailash.nodes.data import CSVReaderNode
from kailash.nodes.ai import LLMAgentNode
from kailash.nodes.api import HTTPRequestNode
from kailash.nodes.logic import SwitchNode, MergeNode
from kailash.nodes.code import PythonCodeNode
from kailash.nodes.base import Node, NodeParameter

# Example setup
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
# Runtime should be created separately
runtime = LocalRuntime()

def workflow.()  # Type signature example -> dict:
    """Process with full IDE support."""
    # Your complex logic here
    return {'result': processed_data}

node = PythonCodeNode.from_function(
    name="processor",
    func=process_data
)

```

### 2. Data Integration
```python
from examples.utils.data_paths import get_input_data_path, get_output_data_path

# Input data from /data/inputs/
data_file = get_input_data_path("customer_value.csv")

# Output to /data/outputs/
report_file = get_output_data_path("risk_report.json", "json")

```

### 3. Risk Scoring
```python
risk_score = (
    activity_score * 0.5 +
    financial_score * 0.3 +
    history_score * 0.2
)

```

### 4. AI Integration
```python
analyzer = LLMAgentNode(
    model="gpt-4",
    system_prompt="You are a financial risk expert...",
    prompt="Analyze: {{data}}"
)

```

## Customization

Each workflow can be customized by:
1. Modifying risk thresholds and parameters in the functions
2. Adjusting AI prompts for different analysis styles
3. Adding additional data sources or indicators
4. Implementing custom business rules

## Integration

These workflows can be integrated into larger systems via:
- REST API endpoints (see `kailash.api.workflow_api`)
- Message queues for real-time processing
- Scheduled batch processing
- Event-driven architectures

## Performance Considerations

- Workflows are optimized for datasets up to 100k records
- Use parallel processing for larger datasets
- Consider caching for frequently accessed reference data
- Implement streaming for real-time data sources

## Security Notes

- Never commit real customer data to version control
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement proper access controls in production
- Audit all AI-generated recommendations before execution

## Node Recommendations

- **CSVReaderNode**: For structured financial data
- **JSONReaderNode**: For real-time transaction streams
- **PythonCodeNode.from_function()**: For complex calculations
- **LLMAgentNode**: For intelligent analysis and recommendations
- **JSONWriterNode**: For structured report output
- **SwitchNode**: For routing based on risk levels
- **WorkflowConnectionPool**: For production database operations
- **AsyncSQLDatabaseNode**: For simple async queries (non-production)
