## Implementation Patterns

### Common Design Principles

1. **Value Flow Mapping**
   - Each workflow maps to specific business value
   - Clear input → process → output definition
   - Measurable business outcomes

2. **Industry Compliance**
   - Built-in regulatory requirements
   - Audit trail capabilities
   - Data privacy controls

3. **Scalability First**
   - Async operations for high concurrency
   - Connection pooling strategies
   - Caching and optimization

4. **AI Integration**
   - LLM-powered insights
   - Vector similarity search
   - Predictive analytics

### Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Industry**
   ```python
   from kailash_workflows.investment import create_portfolio_analysis_workflow

   workflow = create_portfolio_analysis_workflow()

   ```

2. **Configure for Your Needs**
   ```python
# SDK Setup for example
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime
from kailash.nodes.data import CSVReaderNode
from kailash.nodes.ai import LLMAgentNode
from kailash.nodes.api import HTTPRequestNode
from kailash.nodes.logic import SwitchNode, MergeNode
from kailash.nodes.code import PythonCodeNode
from kailash.nodes.base import Node, NodeParameter

# Example setup
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
# Runtime should be created separately
runtime = LocalRuntime()

workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
# Workflow setup goes here  # Method signature

   ```

3. **Execute with Your Data**
   ```python
# SDK Setup for example
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime
from kailash.nodes.data import CSVReaderNode
from kailash.nodes.ai import LLMAgentNode
from kailash.nodes.api import HTTPRequestNode
from kailash.nodes.logic import SwitchNode, MergeNode
from kailash.nodes.code import PythonCodeNode
from kailash.nodes.base import Node, NodeParameter

# Example setup
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
# Runtime should be created separately
runtime = LocalRuntime()

workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
# Workflow setup goes here  # Method signature

   ```

## Best Practices

### Security
