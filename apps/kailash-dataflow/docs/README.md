# Kailash DataFlow Documentation

Welcome to the DataFlow documentation! DataFlow is a **zero-configuration database framework** with enterprise power, currently undergoing **architectural modernization** (TODO-107) to enhance modularity and maintainability.

## üöß **Architectural Modernization in Progress**

DataFlow is actively being refactored from a monolithic structure to a **modern modular architecture**:
- üîÑ **Current**: Monolithic 526-line file being split into focused modules
- üéØ **Target**: Clean `src/` structure with dedicated engine, models, and feature modules
- ‚úÖ **Stability**: All existing functionality remains fully compatible during transition

### **üîÆ Modernization Roadmap**
**Phase 1** (Active): Architectural refactoring for better maintainability
**Future**: Enhanced developer experience with improved tooling and performance
