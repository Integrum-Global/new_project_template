# DataFlow User Personas & Flows

## Overview

This directory contains detailed user personas and their corresponding user flows for DataFlow. Each persona represents a specific type of developer or user who interacts with DataFlow, with their unique needs, pain points, and success criteria.

## Persona Flow Patterns

### Flow Complexity Levels
- **Level 1 (Basic)**: Single model, simple CRUD
- **Level 2 (Intermediate)**: Multiple models, relationships
- **Level 3 (Advanced)**: Complex workflows, enterprise features
- **Level 4 (Expert)**: Custom nodes, performance optimization

### Common Flow Types
1. **Onboarding Flows**: First-time user experience
2. **Feature Flows**: Specific functionality deep-dive
3. **Integration Flows**: Connecting with external systems
4. **Performance Flows**: High-load, optimization scenarios
5. **Error Flows**: Edge cases, failure scenarios

## Testing Strategy

### 3-Tier Test Coverage
Each persona has comprehensive test coverage across all tiers:

**Tier 1 (Unit Tests)**
- Individual node functionality
- Model validation
- Configuration parsing
- Mock external dependencies

**Tier 2 (Integration Tests)**
- Real database connections
- Workflow execution
- Feature interactions
- Component integration

**Tier 3 (E2E Tests)**
- Complete user journeys
- End-to-end scenarios
- Production-like environments
- Performance benchmarks

### Test Organization
```
tests/personas/[persona_name]/
├── unit/           # Fast, isolated tests
├── integration/    # Real services, moderate speed
└── e2e/           # Complete journeys, slow but comprehensive
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Contributors
1. **Follow the persona** - Each flow should be authentic to that user type
2. **Test the narrative** - E2E tests should tell the user's story
3. **Measure success** - Include relevant performance/usability metrics
4. **Document learnings** - Capture insights for product improvement

### For Product Teams
1. **User research validation** - Validate personas against real users
2. **Feature prioritization** - Use persona priority for roadmap planning
3. **Success metrics** - Track conversion at each flow step
4. **Feedback integration** - Update flows based on user feedback

## Cross-Framework Integration

### DataFlow + Nexus Personas
Some personas span both frameworks:

- **Startup Developer**: Uses DataFlow for data + Nexus for multi-channel access
- **Enterprise Developer**: Uses DataFlow for compliance + Nexus for enterprise features
- **Platform Engineer**: Uses both for comprehensive platform solutions

**Cross-framework flows**: See `docs/integration/cross-framework-personas.md`
