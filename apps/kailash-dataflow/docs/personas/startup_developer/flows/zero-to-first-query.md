# Zero to First Query Flow

**Persona**: [Startup Developer (Sarah)](../README.md)
**Priority**: P1 (Critical)
**Goal**: Get from installation to working database query in under 5 minutes
**Success Criteria**: Query executes and returns expected data

## üìã Flow Overview

This is THE most critical flow for DataFlow adoption. If Sarah can't get up and running quickly, she'll look for alternatives. Every second counts in this flow.

### Target Timeline
- **Minute 0-1**: Installation and setup
- **Minute 1-2**: First model definition
- **Minute 2-4**: First workflow and execution
- **Minute 4-5**: Verification and next steps

### Success Metrics
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Total Time**: < 5 minutes (target: < 3 minutes)
- ‚úÖ **Success Rate**: > 95% completion
- üòä **Experience**: Positive, encouraging, "wow that was easy"
- üîó **Next Action**: Immediately wants to try more features

## üéØ Step-by-Step Flow

### Step 1: Installation (Target: 30 seconds)

**Sarah's Context**: Has Python environment, familiar with pip, wants something that works immediately.

```bash
# This should be the only command needed
pip install kailash-dataflow

# Optional: Verify installation
python -c "from dataflow import DataFlow; print('‚úÖ DataFlow ready!')"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- No additional dependencies required
- No configuration files needed
- Works on Python 3.9+
- Clear success confirmation

### Step 2: First Model (Target: 45 seconds)

**Sarah's Context**: Thinks in terms of user data, familiar with classes/types.

```python
# Create file: quick_start.py
from dataflow import DataFlow

# Zero configuration - should just work
db = DataFlow()

# Define something familiar - a User model
@db.model
class User:
    name: str
    email: str
    active: bool = True  # Defaults should work
```

**Design Decisions**:
- Zero configuration required
- Familiar syntax (Python dataclasses style)
- Sensible defaults
- Common use case (User model)

**Success Criteria**:
- No error messages
- Immediate feedback that model is registered
- Type hints for IDE support

### Step 3: First Workflow (Target: 90 seconds)

**Sarah's Context**: Wants to see data flow, familiar with intuitive APIs.

```python
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime

# Build a simple workflow - create a user
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()

# This should be obvious and intuitive
workflow.add_node("UserCreateNode", "create_user", {
    "name": "Sarah Startup",
    "email": "sarah@startup.com",
    "active": True
})

# Execute and see results
runtime = LocalRuntime()
results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow.build())

# Should get immediate, clear feedback
print(f"Created user: {results['create_user']}")
```

**Design Decisions**:
- Node names follow predictable pattern (ModelNameCreateNode)
- Simple, descriptive parameters
- Immediate execution and results
- Clear output format

**Success Criteria**:
- Intuitive node naming
- No unexpected errors
- Clear results structure
- Immediate feedback

### Step 4: Verification (Target: 60 seconds)

**Sarah's Context**: Wants to verify it actually worked, see the data.

```python
# Read the data back to confirm it worked
read_workflow = WorkflowBuilder()

read_workflow.add_node("UserListNode", "list_users", {
    "filter": {"active": True},
    "limit": 10
})

read_results, _ = runtime.execute(read_workflow.build())
users = read_results["list_users"]

print(f"Found {len(users)} users:")
for user in users:
    print(f"  - {user['name']} ({user['email']})")
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Data is actually persisted
- Query returns expected results
- Results are properly formatted
- Easy to understand output

### Step 5: Next Steps (Target: 45 seconds)

**Sarah's Context**: Excited about what she just accomplished, wants to know what's next.

```python
# Show what else is possible
print("\nüéâ Success! You just:")
print("‚úÖ Defined a data model")
print("‚úÖ Created a workflow")
print("‚úÖ Executed database operations")
print("‚úÖ Verified the results")

print("\nüöÄ Ready for more? Try:")
print("- Adding relationships between models")
print("- Building a complete blog application")
print("- Exploring real-time features")
print("- See: docs/personas/startup_developer/flows/")
```

## üö® Common Failure Points

### Installation Issues
**Problem**: Complex dependencies, compilation errors
**Solution**: Pre-built wheels, minimal dependencies
**Test**: Fresh Python environment on all platforms

### Configuration Confusion
**Problem**: Requires database setup, connection strings
**Solution**: Works with SQLite by default, no config needed
**Test**: Zero configuration should always work

### Unclear APIs
**Problem**: Non-obvious method names, complex parameters
**Solution**: Predictable patterns, auto-completion friendly
**Test**: New developer can guess correct API usage

### Poor Error Messages
**Problem**: Technical stack traces, unclear failures
**Solution**: Beginner-friendly errors with suggestions
**Test**: All error cases have helpful messages

### No Immediate Feedback
**Problem**: Unclear if operations succeeded
**Solution**: Clear success indicators and data visibility
**Test**: Every step provides obvious confirmation
