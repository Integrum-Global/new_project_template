## ⚙️ Workflow Features

### 🏗️ Pure Kailash SDK Implementation
All workflows use:
- `WorkflowBuilder()` for workflow construction
- `LocalRuntime(enable_async=True)` for execution
- SDK nodes (no custom orchestration)
- Proper error handling and audit logging

### 🔄 Real-time Operations
- WebSocket support for live updates
- Event-driven workflow execution
- Real-time monitoring and notifications
- Live dashboard updates

### 🛡️ Enterprise Security
- ABAC/RBAC permission checks
- Comprehensive audit logging
