# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This folder contains architecture decisions specific to this app only.

## Purpose

ADRs help you:
- Document important architectural choices
- Explain the reasoning behind decisions
- Track the evolution of your app's architecture
- Onboard new team members
- Avoid re-litigating past decisions

## Structure

```
adr/
├── README.md           # This file - ADR guide
├── 001-template.md     # ADR template
└── XXX-decision.md     # Your ADRs (numbered sequentially)
```

## Creating ADRs

### 1. Copy the Template
```bash
cp adr/001-template.md adr/002-my-decision.md
```

### 2. Fill in the Details
- **Title**: Short, descriptive name
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context**: What forces you to make this decision?
- **Decision**: What you decided to do
- **Consequences**: What are the positive and negative outcomes?

### 3. Common ADR Topics for Apps
- Database choice and schema design
- API design patterns
- Authentication and authorization strategy
- Third-party service integrations
- Deployment and infrastructure choices
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimization approaches

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Draft ADR for team discussion
2. **Accepted**: Team agrees and implements
3. **Deprecated**: Decision no longer recommended
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

## Best Practices

- **Keep it Short**: 1-2 pages maximum
- **Be Specific**: Focus on this app, not general principles
- **Include Context**: Explain why you needed to decide
- **Date Decisions**: When was this decided?
- **Link Related ADRs**: Reference other decisions

## Example Workflow

```bash
# New architecture decision needed
echo "Need to choose database for user management"

# Create new ADR
cp adr/001-template.md adr/003-database-choice.md

# Edit with your decision
# Title: Database Choice for User Management
# Status: Proposed
# Context: Need to store user data with RBAC...
# Decision: Use PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM...
# Consequences: Pro: ACID compliance, Con: More complex setup...

# After team agreement, update status to "Accepted"
```
