from apps.ai_registry.workflows import execute_simple_search, execute_domain_overview

# Method 1: Use pre-built workflows
results = execute_simple_search("healthcare machine learning", limit=10)
analysis = execute_domain_overview("Healthcare")

# Method 2: Build custom workflows with SDK nodes
workflow = Workflow("ai_research", "AI Implementation Research")

# Load AI Registry data
json_path = "src/solutions/ai_registry/data/combined_ai_registry.json"
reader = JSONReaderNode(name="reader", file_path=json_path)
workflow.add_node("reader", reader)

# Execute and analyze
runtime = LocalRuntime()
results, _ = runtime.execute(workflow)
use_cases = results["reader"]["data"]["use_cases"]

print(f"‚úÖ Loaded {len(use_cases)} AI implementations")

## üö¶ Getting Help

### Quick Start Guide
```bash
# 1. Validate setup first
cd src/solutions/ai_registry
python examples/working_demo.py

# 2. Start the server
python -m apps.ai_registry

# 3. Connect your AI assistant
# 4. Ask: "Show me AI implementations in my industry"
```

### üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "TypeError: run() missing 1 required positional argument: 'context'"
‚úÖ **Fixed**: This was caused by outdated node method signatures. All custom nodes now use `def run(self, **kwargs)` pattern.

#### "TypeError: got an unexpected keyword argument 'max_results'"
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Parameter name mismatch between function calls. Use `limit` instead of `max_results`.

#### "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'"
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Search results are returned as `{"results": [...]}` dict. Extract with `search_result["results"]`.

#### "ImportError: cannot import name 'AIRegistryServer'"
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Circular import resolved. Server imports directly where needed.

#### "No such file or directory"
‚úÖ **Run from correct directory**: `cd src/solutions/ai_registry` then run scripts.

#### **MCP Server Won't Start**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issue**: MCP server async patterns need refinement. Core workflows and tools are functional.

**Test Your Setup**:
```bash
# This should work perfectly:
python examples/working_demo.py

# Output should show:
# ‚úÖ Loaded 187 AI use cases
# ‚úÖ Found 3 results for 'healthcare'
# ‚úÖ MCP server provides 10 tools
```

```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Broad, Then Focus**: Begin with industry-wide searches, then narrow to specific use cases
2. **Look for Production Status**: Focus on "Production" implementations for proven approaches
3. **Check Multiple Domains**: Sometimes the best ideas come from adjacent industries
4. **Use Natural Language**: The AI assistant understands context and nuance
5. **Ask Follow-up Questions**: Dive deeper into interesting implementations
