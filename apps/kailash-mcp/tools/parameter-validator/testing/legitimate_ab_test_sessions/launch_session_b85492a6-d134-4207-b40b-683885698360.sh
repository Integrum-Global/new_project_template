I need help creating a Kailash SDK workflow. Here are the requirements:

Challenge: Performance Tracker - Advanced Integration
Description: Create a monitoring workflow that collects system metrics, analyzes performance data, and triggers alerts when needed. Implement enterprise-grade monitoring capabilities. Combine multiple processing patterns for maximum efficiency.

Requirements:
- Use appropriate Kailash SDK nodes for the task
- Implement proper error handling for external dependencies
- Include logging and monitoring capabilities
- Ensure data validation at input and output stages
- Support configurable parameters for different environments
- Implement retry logic for unreliable operations
- Include performance optimization for large data volumes
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Support parallel processing where applicable
- Implement comprehensive audit logging
- Support dynamic workflow reconfiguration
- Include metrics collection and reporting
- Ensure enterprise-grade reliability patterns

Constraints:
- Use LocalRuntime for execution
- Maximum 20 nodes in the workflow
- Demonstrate enterprise architecture patterns
- Include both cycles and parallel processing

Please create a complete workflow that meets these requirements.
