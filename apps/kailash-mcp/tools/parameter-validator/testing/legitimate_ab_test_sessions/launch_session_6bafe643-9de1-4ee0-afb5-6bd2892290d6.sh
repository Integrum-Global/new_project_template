I need help creating a Kailash SDK workflow. Here are the requirements:

Challenge: Reorder Point Calculator with Parallel Processing
Description: Create a moderate workflow system for automated processing and analysis. Optimize for concurrent processing of multiple data streams.

Requirements:
- Use appropriate Kailash SDK nodes for the task
- Implement proper error handling for external dependencies
- Include logging and monitoring capabilities
- Ensure data validation at input and output stages
- Support configurable parameters for different environments
- Implement retry logic for unreliable operations

Constraints:
- Use LocalRuntime for execution
- Maximum 8 nodes in the workflow
- Use only standard Kailash SDK nodes

Please create a complete workflow that meets these requirements.
