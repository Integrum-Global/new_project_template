I need help creating a Kailash SDK workflow. Here are the requirements:

Challenge: Reorder Point Calculator with Feedback Loop
Description: Create a complex workflow system for automated processing and analysis. Include iterative refinement based on quality feedback.

Requirements:
- Use appropriate Kailash SDK nodes for the task
- Implement proper error handling for external dependencies
- Include logging and monitoring capabilities
- Ensure data validation at input and output stages
- Support configurable parameters for different environments
- Implement retry logic for unreliable operations
- Include performance optimization for large data volumes
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Support parallel processing where applicable
- Implement convergence criteria to avoid infinite loops

Constraints:
- Use LocalRuntime for execution
- Maximum 12 nodes in the workflow
- Include at least one cycle or parallel branch

Please create a complete workflow that meets these requirements.
