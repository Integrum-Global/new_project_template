# Migration Overview

The Kailash SDK Template includes a comprehensive migration system to help you convert existing projects to the Kailash SDK workflow architecture.

## Why Migrate to Kailash SDK?

### Benefits

1. **Modular Architecture**: Break complex systems into reusable workflow nodes
2. **Visual Workflows**: Understand data flow at a glance
3. **Built-in Best Practices**: Error handling, logging, and monitoring
4. **Scalability**: Easy to scale individual components
5. **Testing**: Simplified unit and integration testing
6. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

### When to Consider Migration

- Your codebase has become difficult to maintain
- You need better modularity and reusability
- You want to visualize and optimize data flows
- You're planning to scale your system
- You need better testing and monitoring

## Migration Process Overview

### 1. Analysis Phase

Before writing any code, thoroughly analyze your existing system:

- **Architecture Review**: Understand the current system design
- **Technology Assessment**: Identify all technologies and dependencies
- **API Mapping**: Document all endpoints and their purposes
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Map how data moves through the system
- **Integration Points**: Identify external services and databases

### 2. Planning Phase

Create a comprehensive migration plan:

- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and mitigate potential issues
- **Phased Approach**: Break migration into manageable phases
- **Resource Planning**: Allocate team and time resources
- **Testing Strategy**: Plan for comprehensive testing
- **Rollback Procedures**: Ensure you can revert if needed

### 3. Implementation Phase

Execute the migration in phases:

- **Foundation Setup**: Create Kailash project structure
- **Core Migration**: Convert business logic to workflows
- **Integration Migration**: Update external connections
- **Data Migration**: Transfer data with validation
- **Testing & Validation**: Ensure functionality is preserved

### 4. Deployment Phase

Deploy the migrated system:

- **Staging Deployment**: Test in production-like environment
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure performance requirements are met
- **Gradual Rollout**: Use feature flags for controlled release
- **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring
- **Documentation**: Update all documentation

## Migration Tools and Templates

The template provides several tools to assist with migration:

### Directory Structure

```
migrations/
├── to_migrate/       # Place existing projects here
├── in_progress/      # Active migration projects
├── completed/        # Successfully migrated projects
└── templates/        # Migration document templates
```

### Document Templates

1. **Architecture Analysis Template**
   - System overview
   - Technology stack
   - Component dependencies
   - Performance characteristics

2. **API Mapping Template**
   - Endpoint inventory
   - Request/response schemas
   - Kailash workflow mappings
   - Testing requirements

3. **Migration Plan Template**
   - Phased approach
   - Timeline and milestones
   - Resource allocation
   - Success criteria

4. **Risk Assessment Template**
   - Risk identification
   - Impact analysis
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Contingency plans

5. **Data Migration Template**
   - Data inventory
   - Migration strategy
   - Validation procedures
   - Rollback plans

## Getting Started

1. **Place your project** in `migrations/to_migrate/`:
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/existing/project migrations/to_migrate/my_project
   ```

2. **Follow the migration workflow** in Claude Code:
   ```
   Please analyze the project in migrations/to_migrate/my_project and create a migration plan
   ```

3. **Review generated documents** in `migrations/in_progress/my_project/`

4. **Update master todos** with migration tasks

## Common Migration Patterns

### REST API → Kailash Workflow

```python
# Before: Flask endpoint
@app.route('/api/users/<id>')
def get_user(id):
    user = db.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {id}")
    return jsonify(user)

# After: Kailash workflow
workflow = Workflow("get_user")
input_node = APIInputNode(name="input", expected_params=["id"])
query_node = DatabaseQueryNode(name="query", query="SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id")
output_node = APIOutputNode(name="output", format="json")

workflow.add_nodes([input_node, query_node, output_node])
workflow.connect_sequence([input_node, query_node, output_node])
```

### Data Processing → ETL Workflow

```python
# Before: Monolithic function
def process_daily_data():
    data = read_csv("input.csv")
    cleaned = clean_data(data)
    transformed = transform_data(cleaned)
    save_to_db(transformed)

# After: Kailash ETL workflow
workflow = Workflow("daily_data_processing")
reader = CSVReaderNode(name="reader", file_path="input.csv")
cleaner = DataCleanerNode(name="cleaner", rules=cleaning_rules)
transformer = DataTransformerNode(name="transformer", operations=transform_ops)
writer = DatabaseWriterNode(name="writer", table="processed_data")

workflow.add_nodes([reader, cleaner, transformer, writer])
workflow.connect_sequence([reader, cleaner, transformer, writer])
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a non-critical component
2. **Maintain Compatibility**: Keep APIs compatible during migration
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Write tests for every migrated component
4. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed migration documentation
5. **Involve the Team**: Ensure knowledge transfer happens

## Success Stories
