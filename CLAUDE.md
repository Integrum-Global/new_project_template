# Important Directives üìú
1. Always use kailash SDK with its frameworks to implement.
2. Always use the specialist subagents (nexus-specialist, dataflow-specialist, mcp-specialist, kaizen-specialist) when working with the frameworks.
3. Never attempt to write codes from scratch before checking the frameworks with the specialist subagents.
   - Instead of using direct SQL, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, always check with the dataflow-specialist on how to do it with the dataflow framework
   - Instead of building your own API gateway or use FastAPI, always check with the nexus-specialist on how to do it with the nexus framework
   - Instead of building your own MCP server/client, always check with the mcp-specialist on how to do it with the mcp_server module inside the core SDK
   - Instead of building your own agentic platform, always check with the kaizen-specialist on how to do it with the kaizen framework
4. **CRITICAL: ALWAYS load environment variables from .env before ANY operation**
   - **For pytest**: ALWAYS prefix with environment variables OR use pytest-dotenv.
   - **For Docker**: ALWAYS use docker-compose with env_file OR pass --env-file.
   - **For Python scripts**: Load dotenv at top of file.
   - **NEVER run tests/scripts without checking .env first** - assume ALL API keys exist there

## üèóÔ∏è Documentation

### Core SDK (`sdk-users/`)
**Foundational building blocks** for workflow automation:
- **Purpose**: Custom workflows, fine-grained control, integrations
- **Components**: WorkflowBuilder, LocalRuntime, 110+ nodes, MCP integration
- **Usage**: Direct workflow construction with full programmatic control
- **Install**: `pip install kailash`

### DataFlow (`sdk-users/apps/dataflow/`)
**Zero-config database framework** built on Core SDK:
- **Purpose**: Database operations with automatic model-to-node generation
- **Features**: @db.model decorator generates 9 nodes per model automatically. DataFlow IS NOT AN ORM!
- **Usage**: Database-first applications with enterprise features
- **Install**: `pip install kailash-dataflow`
- **Import**: `from dataflow import DataFlow`

### Nexus (`sdk-users/apps/nexus/`)
**Multi-channel platform** built on Core SDK:
- **Purpose**: Deploy workflows as API + CLI + MCP simultaneously
- **Features**: Unified sessions, zero-config platform deployment
- **Usage**: Platform applications requiring multiple access methods
- **Install**: `pip install kailash-nexus`
- **Import**: `from nexus import Nexus`

### Kaizen (`sdk-users/apps/kaizen/`)
**AI agent framework** built on Core SDK:
- **Purpose**: Production-ready AI agents with multi-modal processing, multi-agent coordination, and enterprise features built on Kailash SDK
- **Features**: Signature-based programming, BaseAgent architecture, automatic optimization, error handling, audit trails
- **Usage**: Agentic applications requiring robust AI capabilities
- **Install**: `pip install kailash-kaizen`
- **Import**: `from kaizen.* import ...`

### Critical Relationships
- **DataFlow, Nexus, and Kaizen are built ON Core SDK** - they don't replace it
- **Framework choice affects development patterns** - different approaches for each
- **All use the same underlying workflow execution** - `runtime.execute(workflow.build())`

  1. Systematic Task Completion - Finishing each task completely before moving on
  2. Test-First Development: Writing all tests before implementation prevented bugs
  3. Comprehensive Testing: Catching issues early with comprehensive tests
  4. Real Infrastructure Testing - NO MOCKING policy found real-world issues
  5. Evidence-Based Tracking: Clear audit trail with file:line references made progress clear
  6. Comprehensive Documentation: Guides provide clear path for users and prevent future support questions
  7. Subagent Specialization - Right agent for each task type
  8. Manual Verification: Running all examples caught integration issues
  9. Design System Foundation: Creating comprehensive design system FIRST prevented inconsistencies
  10. Institutional Directives: Documented design patterns as mandatory guides for future work
  11. Component Reusability: Building 16 reusable components eliminated redundant work
  12. Responsive-First Design: Building responsive patterns from the start prevented mobile/desktop divergence
  13. Dark Mode Built-In: Supporting dark mode in all components from day 1 avoided retrofitting
  14. Design Token System: Using centralized tokens (colors, spacing, typography) enabled easy theme changes

- **Lessons Learned** üéì
  1. Documentation Early: Writing guides after implementation is easier
  2. Pattern Consistency: Following same structure across examples reduces errors
  3. Incremental Validation: Verifying tests pass immediately prevents compounding issues
  4. Comprehensive Coverage: Detailed documentation prevents future questions
  5. Design System as Foundation: Create design system BEFORE features to enforce consistency
  6. Mandatory Guides: Institutionalizing design patterns as "must follow" directives prevents drift
  7. Single Import Pattern: Consolidating all design system exports into one file (design_system.dart) simplifies usage
  8. Component Showcase: Building live demo app while developing components catches UX issues early
  9. Deprecation Fixes: Address all deprecations immediately to prevent tech debt accumulation
  10. Real Device Testing: Testing on actual trackpad/touch reveals issues that simulators miss
  11. Pointer Events for Touch: Low-level pointer events (PointerDownEvent, PointerMoveEvent) handle trackpad/touch better than high-level gestures alone
  12. Responsive Testing: Test at all three breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop) for every feature

## ‚ö° Essential Pattern (All Frameworks)

### For Docker/FastAPI Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
```python
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime import AsyncLocalRuntime  # Docker-optimized runtime

workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
workflow.add_node("NodeName", "id", {"param": "value"})  # String-based
runtime = AsyncLocalRuntime()  # Async-first, no threading
results, run_id = await runtime.execute_workflow_async(workflow.build(), inputs={})  # Same return as LocalRuntime!
```

### For CLI/Scripts (Sync Contexts)
```python
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime import LocalRuntime

workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
workflow.add_node("NodeName", "id", {"param": "value"})  # String-based
runtime = LocalRuntime()  # Inherits from BaseRuntime with 3 mixins
results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow.build())  # ALWAYS .build()
```

### Auto-Detection (Simplest)
```python
from kailash.runtime import get_runtime

# Automatically selects AsyncLocalRuntime for Docker/FastAPI,
# LocalRuntime for CLI/scripts
runtime = get_runtime()  # Defaults to "async" context
```

### Runtime Architecture (Internal)
Both LocalRuntime and AsyncLocalRuntime inherit from BaseRuntime and use shared mixins:

**BaseRuntime Foundation**:
- 29 configuration parameters (debug, enable_cycles, conditional_execution, connection_validation, etc.)
- Execution metadata management (run IDs, workflow caching)
- Common initialization and validation modes (strict, warn, off)

**Shared Mixins**:
- **CycleExecutionMixin**: Cycle execution delegation to CyclicWorkflowExecutor with validation and error wrapping
- **ValidationMixin**: Workflow structure validation (5 methods)
  - validate_workflow(): Checks workflow structure, node connections, parameter mappings
  - _validate_connection_contracts(): Validates connection parameter contracts
  - _validate_conditional_execution_prerequisites(): Validates conditional execution setup
  - _validate_switch_results(): Validates switch node results
  - _validate_conditional_execution_results(): Validates conditional execution results
- **ConditionalExecutionMixin**: Conditional execution and branching logic with SwitchNode support
  - Pattern detection and cycle detection
  - Node skipping and hierarchical execution
  - Conditional workflow orchestration

**LocalRuntime-Specific Features**:
- Enhanced error messages via _generate_enhanced_validation_error()
- Connection context building via _build_connection_context()
- Public validation API: get_validation_metrics(), reset_validation_metrics()

**ParameterHandlingMixin Not Used**:
LocalRuntime uses WorkflowParameterInjector for enterprise parameter handling instead of ParameterHandlingMixin (architectural boundary for complex workflows).

**Usage**:
```python
# Configuration from BaseRuntime (29 parameters)
runtime = LocalRuntime(
    debug=True,
    enable_cycles=True,                    # CycleExecutionMixin
    conditional_execution="skip_branches",  # ConditionalExecutionMixin
    connection_validation="strict"          # ValidationMixin (strict/warn/off)
)
results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow.build())

# Validation metrics (LocalRuntime public API)
metrics = runtime.get_validation_metrics()
runtime.reset_validation_metrics()
```

This architecture ensures consistent behavior between sync and async runtimes with no API changes.

**AsyncLocalRuntime-Specific Features**:
AsyncLocalRuntime extends LocalRuntime with async-optimized execution:
- **WorkflowAnalyzer**: Analyzes workflows to determine optimal execution strategy
- **ExecutionContext**: Async execution context with integrated resource access
- **Execution Strategies**: Automatically selects pure async, mixed, or sync-only execution
- **Level-Based Parallelism**: Executes independent nodes concurrently within dependency levels
- **Thread Pool**: Executes sync nodes without blocking async loop
- **Semaphore Control**: Limits concurrent executions to prevent resource exhaustion

Inherits all LocalRuntime capabilities through MRO:
- All 29 BaseRuntime configuration parameters
- All mixin methods (cycle execution, validation, conditional execution)
- Enhanced error messages and validation metrics

**Usage**:
```python
from kailash.runtime import AsyncLocalRuntime

# Same configuration as LocalRuntime
runtime = AsyncLocalRuntime(
    debug=True,
    enable_cycles=True,                    # CycleExecutionMixin
    conditional_execution="skip_branches",  # ConditionalExecutionMixin
    connection_validation="strict",         # ValidationMixin
    max_concurrent_nodes=10                 # AsyncLocalRuntime-specific
)
results, run_id = await runtime.execute_workflow_async(workflow.build(), inputs={})

# All inherited methods available
runtime.validate_workflow(workflow)  # ValidationMixin
metrics = runtime.get_validation_metrics()  # LocalRuntime
```

This inheritance ensures 100% feature parity between sync and async runtimes, including identical return structures.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Rules
- ALWAYS: `runtime.execute(workflow.build())`
- NEVER: `workflow.execute(runtime)`
- String-based nodes: `workflow.add_node("NodeName", "id", {})`
- Real infrastructure: NO MOCKING in Tiers 2-3 tests
- **Return Structure**: Both LocalRuntime and AsyncLocalRuntime return `(results, run_id)` - identical structure
- **Docker/FastAPI**: Use `AsyncLocalRuntime()` or `WorkflowAPI()` (defaults to async)
- **CLI/Scripts**: Use `LocalRuntime()` for synchronous execution

## üê≥ Docker Deployment
- WorkflowAPI now defaults to AsyncLocalRuntime (async-first, no threads).

### WorkflowAPI (Recommended for Docker)
```python
from kailash.api.workflow_api import WorkflowAPI

# WorkflowAPI automatically uses AsyncLocalRuntime
api = WorkflowAPI(my_workflow)  # Docker-optimized by default
api.run(port=8000)  # No hanging, 10-100x faster
```

### Manual Runtime Selection
```python
from kailash.runtime import AsyncLocalRuntime, LocalRuntime

# For Docker/FastAPI (async contexts)
runtime = AsyncLocalRuntime()

# For CLI/scripts (sync contexts)
runtime = LocalRuntime()

# Or use helper
from kailash.runtime import get_runtime
runtime = get_runtime("async")  # or "sync"
```
