Two utility scripts were created for future maintenance:

   - List, merge, or close template sync PRs across all repos
   - Usage: `python scripts/manage_template_prs.py [list|merge-latest|close-all]`

2. **`scripts/sync_repo_topics.py`**
   - Sync repository topics from template to downstream repos
   - Usage: `python scripts/sync_repo_topics.py [--dry-run]`

### 🎯 Benefits

2. **Consistent Tagging**: All repos created from template are now discoverable via the `kailash-template` topic
3. **Automated Tools**: Scripts can be run periodically to maintain consistency

### 🔮 Recommendations

1. Run `manage_template_prs.py` after each template sync to keep PRs clean
2. Run `sync_repo_topics.py` monthly to ensure new repos get proper topics
3. Consider adding these to GitHub Actions for automation
