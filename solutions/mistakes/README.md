# Solutions Mistake Tracking

This folder contains mistake tracking for cross-app coordination and tenant-level solutions.

## Purpose

Solutions-level mistake tracking helps learn from:
- Cross-app integration failures
- Shared service outages and issues
- Data synchronization problems
- Infrastructure coordination mistakes
- Multi-app deployment failures

## Scope

### Solutions mistakes cover:
✅ **Cross-app coordination failures**  
✅ **Shared service outages**  
✅ **Data integration issues**  
✅ **Infrastructure problems affecting multiple apps**  
✅ **Security incidents across apps**  
✅ **Tenant provisioning failures**

### App-specific mistakes belong in apps/
❌ **Single app bugs** → Use `apps/my_app/mistakes/`  
❌ **App-specific performance issues** → Use `apps/my_app/mistakes/`  
❌ **App-specific configuration errors** → Use `apps/my_app/mistakes/`

## Common Mistake Categories

### Cross-App Integration Issues
- Service discovery failures between apps
- API version mismatches across apps
- Authentication token propagation failures
- Data format inconsistencies between apps

### Shared Service Problems
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Cache invalidation across multiple apps
- Load balancer configuration errors
- Single points of failure in shared services

### Data Synchronization Issues
- Event ordering problems in message queues
- Data consistency failures across app databases
- Race conditions in cross-app workflows
- Backup and restore coordination failures

### Infrastructure Coordination Problems
- Container orchestration issues
- Network policy misconfigurations
- Resource allocation conflicts
- Multi-app deployment ordering issues

### Security & Compliance Mistakes
- Cross-app authorization policy conflicts
- Audit log aggregation failures
- Compliance reporting inconsistencies
- Security incident response coordination issues

## Quick Reference Format

```markdown
## [Date] Error: Brief Description
**Problem:** Cross-app coordination issue description
**Apps Affected:** [list of affected apps]  
**Solution:** How the issue was resolved
**Prevention:** Process/architecture changes to prevent recurrence
**Tags:** [integration, shared-service, data-sync, infrastructure, security]
```

## Detailed Documentation

For complex cross-app issues, use the template format:

### Root Cause Analysis
- Why the cross-app integration failed
- Which assumptions about app coordination were wrong
- How the failure propagated across apps

### Impact Assessment  
- Which apps were affected
- User impact across the tenant
- Business process disruptions

### Resolution Approach
- How coordination was restored
- Which app teams were involved
- Timeline for full resolution

## Team Learning Practices

### Incident Response
1. **Document immediately** during cross-app incidents
2. **Coordinate with app teams** for complete picture
3. **Track resolution** across all affected systems

### Post-Incident Review
1. **Cross-app retrospective** with all affected teams
2. **Architecture review** to prevent similar issues
3. **Process improvements** for better coordination

### Knowledge Sharing
1. **Solutions team learnings** shared with app teams
2. **App team insights** incorporated into solutions design
3. **Industry best practices** research and adoption

## Integration Failure Patterns

### Common Integration Mistakes

#### Authentication Propagation
```markdown
## [Date] Error: SSO Token Validation Failed Across Apps
**Problem:** User authenticated in user_mgmt app but rejected by analytics app
**Apps Affected:** user_management, analytics, studio
**Solution:** Synchronized JWT validation keys across all apps
**Prevention:** Centralized key rotation process with app notification
**Tags:** [integration, authentication]
```

#### Data Consistency
```markdown
## [Date] Error: User Data Out of Sync Between Apps
**Problem:** User profile updated in user_mgmt but analytics still showing old data
**Apps Affected:** user_management, analytics
**Solution:** Implemented event-driven sync with retry mechanism
**Prevention:** Added data consistency monitoring and alerts
**Tags:** [data-sync, consistency]
```

#### Service Discovery
```markdown
## [Date] Error: Analytics App Cannot Find User Management Service
**Problem:** Service mesh configuration error caused service discovery failure
**Apps Affected:** analytics, studio (both depend on user_mgmt)
**Solution:** Fixed service mesh DNS configuration
**Prevention:** Added service connectivity health checks
**Tags:** [infrastructure, service-discovery]
```

## Mistake Prevention Strategies

### Architecture Patterns
- Circuit breaker patterns for cross-app calls
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Health check endpoints for all shared services

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Cross-app transaction tracing
- Data consistency monitoring
- Service dependency health checks
- Multi-app deployment verification

### Testing Strategies
- Integration testing across apps
- Chaos engineering for failure scenarios
- End-to-end testing of cross-app workflows
- Performance testing under load

## Cross-App Incident Management

### Detection
```bash
# Monitor cross-app health
curl -f http://user-mgmt/health && curl -f http://analytics/health
# Check service mesh connectivity
kubectl get servicemonitor
# Verify data synchronization
./scripts/verify-cross-app-data-consistency.sh
```

### Communication
```markdown
# Incident notification template
**INCIDENT**: Cross-app integration failure
**AFFECTED APPS**: user_management, analytics
**IMPACT**: Users cannot see updated profile data
**STATUS**: Investigating
**ETA**: 30 minutes
**TEAMS**: @solutions-team @user-mgmt-team @analytics-team
```

### Documentation
```bash
# Create incident documentation
cp solutions/mistakes/template.md solutions/mistakes/$(date +%Y%m%d)-cross-app-incident.md
# Document in real-time during incident
# Complete post-incident analysis
```

## Collaboration with App Teams

### Information Sharing
- Solutions mistakes shared with relevant app teams
- App-specific mistakes reviewed for cross-app implications
- Joint post-mortems for incidents affecting multiple apps

### Process Coordination
- Standardized incident response across apps
- Coordinated deployment strategies
- Shared runbooks for common cross-app issues

### Architecture Evolution
- Solutions architecture updates based on app team learnings
- App architecture changes to improve cross-app reliability
- Regular architecture review meetings
