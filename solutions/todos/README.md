# Solutions Task Tracking

This folder contains task tracking for cross-app coordination and tenant-level solutions work.

## Purpose

Solutions-level task tracking helps coordinate:
- Cross-app workflow development
- Shared service implementation
- Data integration projects
- Infrastructure setup for multiple apps
- System-wide feature rollouts

## Scope

### Solutions todos cover:
✅ **Cross-app workflow implementation**  
✅ **Shared service development**  
✅ **Data integration setup**  
✅ **Multi-app infrastructure tasks**  
✅ **System-wide monitoring and security**  
✅ **Tenant-level configuration**

### App-specific todos belong in apps/
❌ **Single app feature development** → Use `apps/my_app/todos/`  
❌ **App-specific bug fixes** → Use `apps/my_app/todos/`  
❌ **App-specific testing** → Use `apps/my_app/todos/`

## Structure

```

## Task Categories

### Cross-App Orchestration
- [ ] 🔄 Design user onboarding workflow (user_mgmt + analytics + notifications)
- [ ] 🔄 Implement tenant provisioning across all apps
- [ ] 🔄 Set up cross-app event streaming

### Shared Services
- [ ] 🔧 Build centralized authentication service
- [ ] 🔧 Implement shared caching layer
- [ ] 🔧 Set up centralized logging service

### Data Integration
- [ ] 📊 Design cross-app data synchronization
- [ ] 📊 Implement user data federation
- [ ] 📊 Set up cross-app analytics pipeline

### Infrastructure
- [ ] 🏗️ Configure multi-app Docker compose
- [ ] 🏗️ Set up Kubernetes namespace per tenant
- [ ] 🏗️ Implement cross-app monitoring

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] 🔒 Design cross-app RBAC policies
- [ ] 🔒 Implement audit logging aggregation
- [ ] 🔒 Set up compliance reporting pipeline

## Priority Levels

- `🔥 CRITICAL`: Blocking multiple app teams
- `⚡ HIGH`: Needed for upcoming release
- `📋 MEDIUM`: Planned for next sprint
- `🔍 LOW`: Future enhancement

## Status Tracking

- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress  
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[!]` - Blocked (usually waiting on app teams)
- `[?]` - Needs clarification from stakeholders

## Team Coordination

### Solutions Architect Tasks
```bash
# Weekly planning
echo "- [ ] 🔄 Review cross-app integration patterns" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md
echo "- [ ] 📊 Design tenant analytics dashboard" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md

# Daily coordination
echo "- [~] 🔧 Implement SSO service (waiting on user_mgmt team)" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md
```

### Cross-App Dependencies
```bash
# Track dependencies on app teams
echo "- [!] 🔄 Complete user workflow (blocked: user_mgmt app API changes)" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md
echo "- [?] 📊 Data sync pattern (needs: analytics team requirements)" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md
```

## Integration with App Todos

### Solutions → App Dependencies
```bash
# In solutions/todos/000-master.md
echo "- [ ] 🔄 User onboarding workflow [DEPENDS: apps/user_mgmt/todos - API endpoints]" >> 000-master.md

# In apps/user_management/todos/000-master.md  
echo "- [ ] ⚡ Create user API endpoints [FOR: solutions user onboarding]" >> 000-master.md
```

### Communication Pattern
1. **Solutions identifies need** → creates solutions todo
2. **Solutions requests app work** → app team creates app todo
3. **App completes work** → notifies solutions team
4. **Solutions integrates** → completes solutions todo

## Workflow Examples

### Cross-App Feature Implementation
```bash
# 1. Solutions planning
echo "- [ ] 🔥 Implement single sign-on across all apps" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md

# 2. Break down into app dependencies
echo "- [ ] Design SSO architecture" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md
echo "- [ ] Request user_mgmt app: JWT token validation"
echo "- [ ] Request analytics app: SSO login tracking"  
echo "- [ ] Request studio app: SSO integration"

# 3. Coordinate with app teams
# Apps create their specific todos in their own todos/ folders

# 4. Implement solutions coordination
echo "- [~] Build centralized SSO service" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md

# 5. Integration testing
echo "- [ ] Test SSO across all apps" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md
```

### Infrastructure Rollout
```bash
# 1. Infrastructure planning
echo "- [ ] 🏗️ Set up monitoring for all apps" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md

# 2. Solutions implementation
echo "- [ ] Configure Prometheus for multi-app metrics" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md
echo "- [ ] Set up Grafana dashboards" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md

# 3. App integration requests
echo "- [ ] Request all apps: Add monitoring endpoints"

# 4. Validation
echo "- [ ] Verify monitoring coverage across all apps" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md
```

## Conflict Prevention

### Clear Ownership
- **Solutions Architect**: Owns solutions/todos/
- **App Teams**: Own apps/*/todos/
- **DevOps Team**: May contribute to infrastructure todos

### Dependency Tracking
- Use `[DEPENDS: app/feature]` notation for clarity
- Reference specific app todos when possible
- Update status when dependencies are resolved

### Regular Sync
- Weekly solutions standup for cross-app coordination
- Monthly review of solutions todos with all app teams
- Quarterly planning for major cross-app initiatives

*Solutions todos coordinate work across multiple apps while respecting app team autonomy and preventing merge conflicts.*
