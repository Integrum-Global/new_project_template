# Solutions Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains architecture decisions for cross-app coordination and tenant-level solutions.

## Purpose

Solutions-level ADRs document decisions about:
- Cross-app workflow orchestration
- Shared service architectures
- Data integration patterns
- Tenant-level infrastructure choices
- System-wide security and compliance decisions

## Scope

### Solutions ADRs cover:
✅ **Cross-app coordination patterns**  
✅ **Shared service designs**  
✅ **Data integration architectures**  
✅ **Tenant-level infrastructure**  
✅ **System-wide security policies**  
✅ **Multi-app deployment strategies**

### App-specific ADRs belong in apps/
❌ **Single app architecture decisions** → Use `apps/my_app/adr/`  
❌ **App-specific API designs** → Use `apps/my_app/adr/`  
❌ **App-specific database schemas** → Use `apps/my_app/adr/`

## Common Solutions ADR Topics

### Cross-App Orchestration
- Workflow coordination patterns between apps
- Event-driven architecture decisions
- Service mesh or API gateway choices
- Inter-app communication protocols

### Shared Services
- Authentication/authorization service design
- Shared database vs. federated data decisions
- Caching strategies across apps
- Monitoring and observability architecture

### Data Integration
- Data synchronization patterns
- Master data management approaches
- Event streaming vs. batch processing
- Data consistency and transaction patterns

### Infrastructure
- Multi-tenant deployment strategies
- Container orchestration decisions
- Network security and isolation
- Backup and disaster recovery plans

### Security & Compliance
- Cross-app security policies
- Audit logging centralization
- Compliance reporting automation
- Data privacy and retention policies

## Example ADRs

### ADR-001: Cross-App Authentication Strategy
```markdown
# ADR-001: Centralized Authentication Service

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-01-15

## Context
Multiple apps (user_management, analytics, studio) need authentication,
and users expect single sign-on across all applications.

## Decision
Implement centralized JWT-based authentication service in solutions/shared_services/auth/

## Consequences
+ Single sign-on across all apps
+ Consistent security policies
+ Easier user management
- Additional complexity in service coordination
- Single point of failure (mitigated with redundancy)
```

### ADR-002: Data Integration Pattern
```markdown
# ADR-002: Event-Driven Data Synchronization

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-20

## Context
User data in user_management app needs to be synchronized with
analytics app for reporting and insights.

## Decision
Use event-driven architecture with message queue for data sync,
not direct database connections between apps.

## Consequences
+ Loose coupling between apps
+ Eventual consistency model
+ Better scalability
- More complex debugging
- Need for message queue infrastructure
```

## ADR Creation Workflow

### 1. Identify Cross-App Decision
```bash
# When you need to make a decision that affects multiple apps
echo "Need to decide how to handle cross-app user sessions"
```

### 2. Create ADR
```bash
cp solutions/adr/001-template.md solutions/adr/003-session-management.md
# Fill in the details
```

### 3. Review and Accept
```bash
# After team discussion, update status to "Accepted"
# Document in solutions/todos/ if implementation is needed
echo "- [ ] Implement cross-app session management" >> solutions/todos/000-master.md
```

## Integration with App ADRs

- See apps/analytics/adr/001-user-tracking.md for user data requirements

# In apps/user_management/adr/002-local-auth.md

```

### Decision Hierarchy
1. **Solutions ADRs** set cross-app patterns and constraints
2. **App ADRs** implement solutions patterns for specific apps
3. App decisions must be compatible with solutions decisions

## Review Process

### Weekly Solutions Review
- Review new solutions ADRs with solutions architect
- Check compatibility with existing app decisions
- Validate implementation feasibility across apps

### Monthly Cross-App Alignment
- Review solutions ADRs with all app teams
- Identify conflicts or gaps in coordination
- Update ADRs based on implementation learnings

---

*Solutions ADRs ensure coordinated decision-making across multiple apps while preserving app team autonomy for app-specific decisions.*
