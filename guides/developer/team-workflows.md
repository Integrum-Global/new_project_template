# Team Workflows Guide

Complete guide for team collaboration, Git workflows, and coordination strategies when working with the client project template.

## 🎯 Overview

This template is designed for **conflict-free multi-developer collaboration** through isolated project management and clear coordination patterns. Teams can work simultaneously on different applications without stepping on each other.

## 👥 Team Structure & Roles

### Role Responsibilities

| Role | Primary Focus | Work Areas |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Project Lead** | Overall coordination, client communication | `guides/developer/`, project-level ADRs |
| **App Lead** | Individual app architecture and quality | `apps/app_name/`, app-specific coordination |
| **App Developer** | Feature development within assigned app | `apps/app_name/workflows/`, `apps/app_name/tests/` |
| **Solutions Architect** | Cross-app coordination, shared services | `solutions/`, cross-app integration patterns |

| **QA Engineer** | Testing strategy, quality assurance | All `tests/` directories, test automation |

## 🏗️ Isolation Strategy

### App-Level Isolation

Each application has **completely isolated project management**:

```
apps/user_management/          apps/analytics/
├── adr/                       ├── adr/
│   ├── 001-auth-strategy.md   │   ├── 001-data-pipeline.md
│   └── 002-database-choice.md │   └── 002-visualization.md
├── todos/                     ├── todos/
│   ├── 000-master.md          │   ├── 000-master.md
│   └── 001-sprint-planning.md │   └── 001-performance.md
├── mistakes/                  ├── mistakes/
│   ├── 000-master.md          │   ├── 000-master.md
│   └── auth-pitfalls.md       │   └── data-quality.md
└── tests/                     └── tests/
    ├── unit/                      ├── unit/
    ├── integration/               ├── integration/
    └── functional/                └── functional/
```

### Benefits of Isolation

1. **No Merge Conflicts**: Teams never edit the same files
2. **Independent Planning**: Each app has its own roadmap and priorities
3. **Focused Documentation**: App-specific decisions stay with the app
4. **Clear Ownership**: Obvious responsibility boundaries
5. **Parallel Development**: Teams work simultaneously without coordination overhead

## 🔄 Git Workflow Strategy

## 🛟 Conflict Resolution

### Preventing Conflicts

**Structural Prevention:**
- **Isolated Workspaces**: Each app has separate directories
- **Clear Ownership**: Defined responsibility boundaries
- **Communication Channels**: Regular sync meetings
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent ADR and TODO processes

**Process Prevention:**
```bash
# Before starting work, check for conflicts
git pull origin develop

# Check if other teams are working on related features
grep -r "my_feature" apps/*/todos/
grep -r "my_feature" solutions/todos/

# Communicate with affected teams
# Update project coordination channel
```

### Resolving Technical Conflicts

**When Apps Need the Same Shared Functionality:**
1. **Identify the Conflict**: Multiple apps implementing similar features
2. **Evaluate Options**: 
   - Move to shared services in solutions layer
   - Create SDK node for reusability
   - Keep separate if truly app-specific
3. **Design Shared Solution**: If needed, create in `solutions/shared_services/`
4. **Refactor Apps**: Update apps to use shared solution
5. **Document Decision**: Record in relevant ADRs

**Example Resolution:**
```bash
# Problem: Both user_management and analytics need email sending
# Solution: Create shared email service

# 1. Create shared service
mkdir -p solutions/shared_services/email_service

# 2. Implement shared email workflow
# solutions/shared_services/email_service/email_workflow.py

# 3. Update apps to use shared service
# apps/user_management/workflows/notification_workflow.py
# apps/analytics/workflows/report_workflow.py

# 4. Document decision
echo "# Shared Email Service Decision" > solutions/adr/002-shared-email.md
```

## 📊 Metrics and KPIs

grep -r "blocked" solutions/todos/  # Check for coordination blockers

# Assess documentation quality
find . -name "adr" -type d -exec ls -la {} \;  # Ensure ADRs are being created

# Check test coverage trends
find . -name "test_*.py" | wc -l  # Monitor test growth
```
